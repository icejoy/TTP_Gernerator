 Earlier this year, the Internet blew up over the topic of whether Apple should assist the FBI by providing access to a deceased terrorist’s iPhone. Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, referred to government’s demands as asking for the “equivalent of a master key, capable of opening hundreds of millions of locks.” In the end, the FBI gained access through undisclosed means and withdrew the request, but the notion of backdoor access is something that has been coveted by malware authors, spies, and nation-states for decades. Tactics for accomplishing this goal range from persuading victims via social engineering to hand over the keys to their devices, to intercepting hardware in the supply chain and inserting backdoors to surreptitiously gain remote access. However, the most common method is through the deployment of Trojan software.<br>

A SOC is a facility in which —Douglas Frosst, Barbara Kay, Bart Lenaerts-Bergmans, and Rick Simon information systems (websites, applications, databases, data centers A few years ago, dedicated security operations centers (SOCs) seemed to be and servers, networks, desktops, going the way of the dinosaur—the era of big rooms with big monitors and teams and other endpoints) are monitored, of analysts seemed ready to be replaced by distributed teams, outsourced, or assessed, and defended. disbanded entirely. If you were not in the defense department or on Wall Street, many thought, then you did not need a SOC. Then targeted attacks and insider threats moved from movie and government plots to an everyday reality for enterprises. According to an Intel Security survey, 68% of investigations in 2015 involved a specific entity, either as a targeted external attack or an insider threat.<br>
paragraph 5 is :<br>
Whether from an increase in attacks or better monitoring capabilities, most companies (67%) reported an increase in security incidents, with 51% saying they have increased a little, and 16% that they have increased a lot. This is analogous to findings from the key topic “Information theft: the who, how, and prevention of data leakage” in the McAfee Labs Threats Report: September 2016. That primary research study found that organizations which watched data more closely for leakage reported more data-loss incidents.<br>

paragraph 8 is :<br>
 For the next 12 to 18 months, most organizations (71%) expect their MSSP use to remain the same, while 19% expect it to increase and 10% expect it to decrease. Those that expect MSSP use to decrease are bringing more security operations in house to improve incident response and the quality of investigations. Those that expect it to increase are looking to external partners to improve investigations and scoping of potential incidents, and broaden security monitoring and monitoring coverage. Basically, choosing internal or external resources for security operations is most likely dependent on the availability of internal personnel, external services, and the comparative skill levels. As a result, there is some variance by country, with German organizations primarily interested in improving advanced threat detection with MSSPs, and UK outfits looking for help with technology such as big data platforms, analytics, and threat intelligence.<br>
paragraph 9 is :<br>
 The ability to quickly identify, investigate, and resolve threats is probably the most important aspect of today’s security operations. Preventing 100% of attacks may never be achievable, but security information and event management (SIEM) often provides a real-time understanding of the world outside—threat data, reputation feeds, and vulnerability status—as well as a view of the systems, users, data, risks, and activities inside, obtained through continuous monitoring and correlation. Actionable intelligence and situational awareness delivered by a SIEM may help orchestrate security operations and, when an incident is detected, may enable better collaboration for faster incident response.<br>

 The majority of organizations (55%) reported that firewall logs are the primary source used for advanced threat detection and investigation, followed by endpoint logs (34%) and system logs (32%). Other data, such as logs from VPN activity, web proxies, DNS, and DHCP servers are used by 20% or less. Historical data, important for forensic investigations or historical correlation, is typically retained for between 45 and 60 days. Firewall logs, endpoint threat detection logs, and Active Directory logs are retained for the longest period.<br>

Viruses differ from Trojans in that they recursively self-replicate, meaning that they spread to other files, those files in turn spread to other files, and so on. Part of the threat is the replication logic, which decides the files to target and where to insert malicious routines. Viruses can be analyzed and reverse engineered, and the replication logic and markers provide an additional detection surface for antivirus software. Parasitic Trojans, on the other hand, do not self-replicate, allowing for inserted code to be streamlined toward the desired payload without the additional overhead and corresponding detection surface.

 Most malicious applications today are rotten to the core. They serve one purpose, to profit bad actors, subjecting their victims to attacks. The tactical We see a trend toward objectives of such crimes are generally to reach the target, establish a presence, “Trojanizing” legitimate and persist for an extended time. To reach their targets, attackers either draw applications, which are injected victims in through social engineering or intercept their everyday computer with malicious nonreplicating code. usage, most often through exploitation. In either case, the goal is for those unfortunate enough to cross paths with malicious code to be none the wiser. The longer attacks can go unnoticed, the larger the payout. To this end, attackers are growing more sophisticated as they endeavor to create long lasting, fully undetectable creations.

 In March, the ransomware family KimcilWare appeared. The ransomware does not attack the victims’ machines but instead targets websites that use Magento ecommerce store files. By encrypting the files with a Rijndael (AES) block cipher and appending the extension .kimcilware at the end of each file, the store’s files become useless. The attacker can be contacted on a Hotmail account and after paying US$140 in Bitcoins, the attacker hands over a decryption key to the victim.<br>

In 2015 and the first half of 2016, the Angler exploit kit was the most popular mechanism for delivering ransomware to potential victims. These exploit kits are popular and have a strong support system. However, in April and May, the volume of Angler traffic dropped dramatically, eventually shutting down completely. It appeared to have been replaced in popularity by Neutrino, although at nowhere near Angler’s volume of traffic. Another shift in exploit kits happened in September, with RIG rising to challenge Neutrino for top spot. Whatever is driving these changes in the ransomware delivery marketplace, expect continued variations as attackers look for new ways to evade defenses.<br>

 Most malicious applications today are rotten to the core. They serve one purpose, to profit bad actors, subjecting their victims to attacks. The tactical We see a trend toward objectives of such crimes are generally to reach the target, establish a presence, “Trojanizing” legitimate and persist for an extended time. To reach their targets, attackers either draw applications, which are injected victims in through social engineering or intercept their everyday computer with malicious nonreplicating code. usage, most often through exploitation. In either case, the goal is for those unfortunate enough to cross paths with malicious code to be none the wiser. The longer attacks can go unnoticed, the larger the payout. To this end, attackers are growing more sophisticated as they endeavor to create long lasting, fully undetectable creations. The more authentic-looking a piece of code, the more likely it is to be overlooked. This is the primary driving factor in an increasing trend of “Trojanizing” legitimate applications, which are injected with malicious nonreplicating code.<br>
paragraph 14 is :<br>
 Another benefit is built-in persistence, or a method of restarting code that was previously terminated. Malware persistence falls into one of two categories: self- persistence, involving the installation of start-up hooks to endure reboots; and companion-persistence, which leverages existing start-up hooks to automatically load before, during, or after other wanted applications. Each system change made by malicious code is an indicator of compromise. Thus the fewer the number of changes, the smaller the detection surface. Trojanizing legitimate applications provides free persistence; the software’s natural method of start-up is all that is necessary for the malicious code to load. In fact, if the program is run manually on a regular basis, then persistence is self-perpetuated by the victims themselves.<br>

 Binders/Joiners Binder programs first appeared in the 1990s and give malware distributors a quick and easy way to bundle their threats with other programs, documents, and multimedia files. Decoupling the malicious code from any social engineering aspects of an attack affords the perpetrators the benefit of customizing each binary for a given campaign, without having to code or recompile a threat. All that is required to build a new customized threat is to select current malware and accompanying files. The binder will combine all of them into a new executable ready for distribution. When a victim runs the program, both the malware and combined file will be run. Although binders do bundle clean and dirty files together, the result is a new piece of malware, which does not closely resemble a legitimate file.<br>

There was no real technical evolution in these attacks, just phishing emails targeting people using essential systems. However, the rest of the year saw considerable technical advances, including partial and full disk encryption, variable and increasing ransom demands, and new ransomware delivery mechanisms.<br>

 BackDoor Factory (BDF) is a popular open-source executable binary patcher that supports Windows, Mac, and Linux binary patching. Target programs are modified to include predefined or user-specified shellcode. BDF allows the operator to specify many options, including the host IP, port, and where to insert the shellcode within the target. Code can be placed in the slack space of a program and spread over one or more cavities, thus maintaining the original file size and executable geometry. This tactic may render certain feature vectors ineffective in machine learning algorithms applied to such threats.<br>

paragraph 3 is :<br>
 For the next 12 to 18 months, most organizations (71%) expect their MSSP use to remain the same, while 19% expect it to increase and 10% expect it to decrease. Those that expect MSSP use to decrease are bringing more security operations in house to improve incident response and the quality of investigations. Those that expect it to increase are looking to external partners to improve investigations and scoping of potential incidents, and broaden security monitoring and monitoring coverage. Basically, choosing internal or external resources for security operations is most likely dependent on the availability of internal personnel, external services, and the comparative skill levels. As a result, there is some variance by country, with German organizations primarily interested in improving advanced threat detection with MSSPs, and UK outfits looking for help with technology such as big data platforms, analytics, and threat intelligence.<br>

Deploying new security technology is another way to enhance capabilities, with more than 60% of organizations planning to invest in tools for these teams. Given the significant percentage of organizations that are not managing to triage and investigate all of their alerts, it is not surprising that key processes are the top two focus areas for new tools: improving the speed and accuracy of initial triage and prioritization of security alerts, and reducing the time and effort it takes to conduct incident investigations.<br>

Common Word documents :<br>

 Binders/Joiners Binder programs first appeared in the 1990s and give malware distributors a quick and easy way to bundle their threats with other programs, documents, and multimedia files. Decoupling the malicious code from any social engineering aspects of an attack affords the perpetrators the benefit of customizing each binary for a given campaign, without having to code or recompile a threat. All that is required to build a new customized threat is to select current malware and accompanying files. The binder will combine all of them into a new executable ready for distribution. When a victim runs the program, both the malware and combined file will be run. Although binders do bundle clean and dirty files together, the result is a new piece of malware, which does not closely resemble a legitimate file.<br>

 In March, the ransomware family KimcilWare appeared. The ransomware does not attack the victims’ machines but instead targets websites that use Magento ecommerce store files. By encrypting the files with a Rijndael (AES) block cipher and appending the extension .kimcilware at the end of each file, the store’s files become useless. The attacker can be contacted on a Hotmail account and after paying US$140 in Bitcoins, the attacker hands over a decryption key to the victim.<br>

 Another benefit is built-in persistence, or a method of restarting code that was previously terminated. Malware persistence falls into one of two categories: self- persistence, involving the installation of start-up hooks to endure reboots; and companion-persistence, which leverages existing start-up hooks to automatically load before, during, or after other wanted applications. Each system change made by malicious code is an indicator of compromise. Thus the fewer the number of changes, the smaller the detection surface. Trojanizing legitimate applications provides free persistence; the software’s natural method of start-up is all that is necessary for the malicious code to load. In fact, if the program is run manually on a regular basis, then persistence is self-perpetuated by the victims themselves.<br>

 These attack scenarios apply to the majority of Internet users. Even those who seldom install new applications are likely to have existing applications configured for autoupdates. It is still commonplace for update servers to deliver binaries over insecure HTTP connections. Connecting to open Wi-Fi hotspots provides others an opportunity to carry out man-in-the-middle attacks. Running untrusted programs remains a significant attack vector, and the ever-growing use of shared libraries increases the overall risk, especially as it pertains to mobile devices and the Internet of Things.<br>

Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, referred to government’s demands as asking for the “equivalent of a master key, capable of opening hundreds of millions of locks.” In the end, the FBI gained access through undisclosed means and withdrew the request, but the notion of backdoor access is something that has been coveted by malware authors, spies, and nation-states for decades.

 Ransomware dates to 1989, when 20,000 infected floppy disks were distributed at the World Health Organization’s AIDS conference. Using symmetric encryption, this attack was quickly broken. The first asymmetric encryption implemented in a cryptovirus attack was published in Adam Young’s 1995 master’s thesis: “Cryptovirology and the Dark Side of Black Box Cryptography.” The size of the virus was a little less than 7KB. It was not until the mid-2000s that asymmetric encryption, which is much more difficult to decipher, was used in a ransomware attack.<br>

 On average three of these teams are involved with investigating a case, scoping it and making a security decision, and responding to or remediating an incident. Median internal staffing levels Median internal staffing levels are 10 to 15 people for each team of Tier 1 SOC are 10 to 15 people for each analysts, Tier 2 SOC analysts, hunters, and incident responders, but only 15% of team of Tier 1 SOC analysts, Tier organizations currently operate all four types of teams.

Only 15% of to augment a team’s skills and capacities, and contribute roughly one-third of organizations currently operate total resources for each team. There is no significant variation in the percentage all four types of teams. of external resources used by country or organization size. However, it is not surprising that larger organizations have larger teams. Although the median staffing level for Tier 1 teams is 15 people regardless of company size, Tier 2, hunter, and incident responder teams are about 50% larger in enterprises than in commercial organizations.<br>
paragraph 8 is :<br>
Methods to address these goals include the three pillars of people, processes, and technology. Of the organizations that do not yet have all four types of security teams operating, 40% plan to deploy internal people into those roles within 12 to 18 months. Similarly, around 40% of organizations plan to increase their use of MSSP people within one or more of these security functions in that period. Deploying new security technology is another way to enhance capabilities, with more than 60% of organizations planning to invest in tools for these teams. Given the significant percentage of organizations that are not managing to triage and investigate all of their alerts, it is not surprising that key processes are the top two focus areas for new tools: improving the speed and accuracy of initial triage and prioritization of security alerts, and reducing the time and effort it takes to conduct incident investigations.<br>

 Petya also brought on increasing ransom demands, doubling the amount if payment was not made within seven days. One ransomware variant threatened to delete one file per hour until the ransom was paid. Another encoded a series of ransom amounts, which it chose based on the name of the distribution file, making it quick and easy to make the demand fit the victim’s ability to pay. In another case, a hospital that paid the first ransom demand was then told to pay again if it wanted to regain access to all of the files. The hospital ignored the second demand, but it remains an ongoing concern that attackers will not be “honorable” in their actions and refuse to release encryption keys even after receiving payment.<br>

Two API calls, GetProcessHeap() and CloseHandle(), one of which should be about 10 times faster on a real system, are run by the malware, which goes dormant if the execution time difference is not as large as expected.<br>

Another new anti-sandbox technique looks at Microsoft Office’s recent files collection. If the number of files in this list is very small, it assumes that it is in a virtual machine and shuts down.

 The idea of riding on the coattails of popular applications harkens to the early days of malware creation, arguably with the inception decades ago of the very first parasitic file-infecting virus. Viruses differ from Trojans in that they recursively self-replicate, meaning that they spread to other files, those files in turn spread to other files, and so on. Part of the threat is the replication logic, which decides the files to target and where to insert malicious routines. Viruses can be analyzed and reverse engineered, and the replication logic and markers provide an additional detection surface for antivirus software. Parasitic Trojans, on the other hand, do not self-replicate, allowing for inserted code to be streamlined toward the desired payload without the additional overhead and corresponding detection surface. This can be an Achilles heel for defenses that are ill equipped to cope with such attacks.<br>

 Binders/Joiners Binder programs first appeared in the 1990s and give malware distributors a quick and easy way to bundle their threats with other programs, documents, and multimedia files. Decoupling the malicious code from any social engineering aspects of an attack affords the perpetrators the benefit of customizing each binary for a given campaign, without having to code or recompile a threat. All that is required to build a new customized threat is to select current malware and accompanying files. The binder will combine all of them into a new executable ready for distribution. When a victim runs the program, both the malware and combined file will be run. Although binders do bundle clean and dirty files together, the result is a new piece of malware, which does not closely resemble a legitimate file.<br>

 The Backdoor Factory Proxy (BDFProxy) takes BDF a step further by patching executables on the fly as they are downloaded, leveraging a man-in-the- middle attack posture. Joshua Pitts, the author of the BDF tools, discovered this approach was actively being used in the wild in 2014 when applications were downloaded via a Tor exit node in Russia. This discovery was made within about an hour after the beginning of his search. In particular, all uncompressed Windows executable files served over nonsecured HTTP connections were modified to include the OnionDuke malware.<br>

 Almost nine out of 10 organizations in this study reported that they have an internal or external SOC, although commercial organizations are slightly less likely to have one (84%) compared with enterprises (91%). Smaller organizations in general are implementing SOCs a bit later than enterprises, as only 44% of commercial groups have had one for more than 12 months, whereas 56% of enterprise SOCs have been around for that long. Most SOCs (60%) are currently run internally, with 23% operating a mix of internal and external support, and 17% fully external. For the few that have not established a SOC, only 2% of enterprises have no plans to do so, versus 7% of commercial companies.<br>

 For the next 12 to 18 months, most organizations (71%) expect their MSSP use to remain the same, while 19% expect it to increase and 10% expect it to decrease. Those that expect MSSP use to decrease are bringing more security operations in house to improve incident response and the quality of investigations. Those that expect it to increase are looking to external partners to improve investigations and scoping of potential incidents, and broaden security monitoring and monitoring coverage. Basically, choosing internal or external resources for security operations is most likely dependent on the availability of internal personnel, external services, and the comparative skill levels. As a result, there is some variance by country, with German organizations primarily interested in improving advanced threat detection with MSSPs, and UK outfits looking for help with technology such as big data platforms, analytics, and threat intelligence.<br>

 Most malicious applications today are rotten to the core. They serve one purpose, to profit bad actors, subjecting their victims to attacks. The tactical We see a trend toward objectives of such crimes are generally to reach the target, establish a presence, “Trojanizing” legitimate and persist for an extended time. To reach their targets, attackers either draw applications, which are injected victims in through social engineering or intercept their everyday computer with malicious nonreplicating code. usage, most often through exploitation. In either case, the goal is for those unfortunate enough to cross paths with malicious code to be none the wiser. The longer attacks can go unnoticed, the larger the payout. To this end, attackers are growing more sophisticated as they endeavor to create long lasting, fully undetectable creations. The more authentic-looking a piece of code, the more likely it is to be overlooked. This is the primary driving factor in an increasing trend of “Trojanizing” legitimate applications, which are injected with malicious nonreplicating code.<br>

 However, penetrating the internal source control server or build system of an organization that produces widely distributed software is generally wrought with challenges. Although instances of this have been made public in the past and are likely to continue in the future, this route is definitely not the path of least resistance.<br>
paragraph 11 is :<br>
 These attack scenarios apply to the majority of Internet users. Even those who seldom install new applications are likely to have existing applications configured for autoupdates. It is still commonplace for update servers to deliver binaries over insecure HTTP connections. Connecting to open Wi-Fi hotspots provides others an opportunity to carry out man-in-the-middle attacks. Running untrusted programs remains a significant attack vector, and the ever-growing use of shared libraries increases the overall risk, especially as it pertains to mobile devices and the Internet of Things.<br>

 The problem of Trojanized legitimate applications is likely to get worse before it gets better. Research and development advancements in penetration testing and vulnerability assessment make it easier to both discover vulnerable applications and systems, as well as exploit them.

If you were not in the defense department or on Wall Street, many thought, then you did not need a SOC. Then targeted attacks and insider threats moved from movie and government plots to an everyday reality for enterprises. According to an Intel Security survey, 68% of investigations in 2015 involved a specific entity, either as a targeted external attack or an insider threat.<br>

 The ability to quickly identify, investigate, and resolve threats is probably the most important aspect of today’s security operations. Preventing 100% of attacks may never be achievable, but security information and event management (SIEM) often provides a real-time understanding of the world outside—threat data, reputation feeds, and vulnerability status—as well as a view of the systems, users, data, risks, and activities inside, obtained through continuous monitoring and correlation. Actionable intelligence and situational awareness delivered by a SIEM may help orchestrate security operations and, when an incident is detected, may enable better collaboration for faster incident response.<br>

 This year, ransomware found a new and vulnerable target: hospitals. Although there was some criticism from the hacker community about these attacks, many of the victims paid, fueling further incidents. There was no real technical evolution in these attacks, just phishing emails targeting people using essential systems. However, the rest of the year saw considerable technical advances, including partial and full disk encryption, variable and increasing ransom demands, and new ransomware delivery mechanisms.<br>

 Ransomware-as-a-service providers recently introduced the concept of bridges, which are PHP scripts that connect attackers with their victims. The script uses itself as a database and stores client keys, operating systems, IP addresses, and ransom amounts, verifies the status of payments and delivers victims’ information to the main servers. Bridges are password protected and avoid detection by search engines.<br>

 At the time, one of the big challenges for attackers was how to get paid without getting caught. They experimented with a variety of methods. The emergence of The emergence of Bitcoin enabled Bitcoin and similar digital currencies in 2009 enabled anonymous transactions anonymous transactions and and provided an important foundation for future growth in ransomware attacks. provided an important foundation CryptoLocker established the modern ransomware era in 2013, incorporating for future growth in ransomware attacks.

Later that year we also saw an increase in the threat of exposure of sensitive files and trashing the operating system, in addition to encrypting the victim’s data.<br>

paragraph 6 is :<br>
 In March we saw the appearance of Petya and partial disk encryption instead of file encryption. This ransomware is often delivered via a fake job-applicant email In March we saw the appearance with a Dropbox link, and begins the attack by overwriting the master boot record, partial disk encryption instead rebooting, and executing the malware, putting up a fake CHKDSK screen that of file encryption. This type of encrypts the master file table. While the files are still on the disk and unaffected, ransomware encrypts the master file table, making files inaccessible. the encrypted file table prevents them from being located. Paying the ransom gets the decryption key, which unlocks the file table and boot record, and removes the malware boot loader.<br>
paragraph 7 is :<br>
 Petya also brought on increasing ransom demands, doubling the amount if payment was not made within seven days. One ransomware variant threatened to delete one file per hour until the ransom was paid. Another encoded a series of ransom amounts, which it chose based on the name of the distribution file, making it quick and easy to make the demand fit the victim’s ability to pay. In another case, a hospital that paid the first ransom demand was then told to pay again if it wanted to regain access to all of the files. The hospital ignored the second demand, but it remains an ongoing concern that attackers will not be “honorable” in their actions and refuse to release encryption keys even after receiving payment.<br>
paragraph 8 is :<br>
 In March, the ransomware family KimcilWare appeared. The ransomware does not attack the victims’ machines but instead targets websites that use Magento ecommerce store files. By encrypting the files with a Rijndael (AES) block cipher and appending the extension .kimcilware at the end of each file, the store’s files become useless. The attacker can be contacted on a Hotmail account and after paying US$140 in Bitcoins, the attacker hands over a decryption key to the victim.<br>
paragraph 9 is :<br>
 Suspicious files are often sent to a “sandbox” for evaluation before being allowed to run on a user’s system. This year, ransomware attackers learned The common “sandbox” method how to differentiate between a sandbox, which is usually a virtual machine, used to detect ransomware can and a live human’s device. In a recent case, Locky, the culprit in many of now be detected and evaded by the hospital ransomware attacks, used encrypted code and execution time some ransomware. differences between real and virtual machines to evade detection. Two API calls, GetProcessHeap() and CloseHandle(), one of which should be about 10 times faster on a real system, are run by the malware, which goes dormant if the execution time difference is not as large as expected.<br>
paragraph 10 is :<br>
Another new anti-sandbox technique looks at Microsoft Office’s recent files collection. If the number of files in this list is very small, it assumes that it is in a virtual machine and shuts down. Or the ownership of the IP address is checked against a list of known security vendors and cloud security providers.<br>

 Generally speaking, ransomware attacks began in the 1990s as seemingly random campaigns, with broad delivery mechanisms used to catch the There has been a significant occasional consumer. In the past year, we have seen a significant shift to business shift by ransomware attackers targets, as a few successful campaigns have encouraged more attacks. Typical to business targets, as a few targets include essential services such as hospitals, but also small and medium- successful campaigns have encouraged more attacks. sized businesses, which often lack a fully staffed cybersecurity operation. The initial attack vector for many of these campaigns is targeted phishing emails aimed at a specific individual or job function. In addition to encrypting files, the malware captures user credentials to steal data or spread the infection throughout the organization.<br>

The code responsible for the full disk New ransomware variants encrypt encryption is not homemade but borrowed from the tool DiskCryptor. Not only complete disk partitions. does this encryption make a partition’s files inaccessible, it also prevents the operating system from booting, requiring victims to use another machine to contact the attacker for payment and recovery instructions. Mamba also adapted the previously described anti–virtual machine technique, using a password as a command-line argument to execute the malware.<br>

 This year has not been solely one of victories for cybercriminals; there were some notable advances on the defensive front as well, including several takedowns, This summer, a group of security keys recovered, and the advent of an anti-ransomware alliance. vendors and law enforcement organizations, led by Europol and including Intel Security, No More Ransom! announced the “No More In July, a group of security vendors and law enforcement organizations, led by Ransom!” collaboration to fight Europol and including Intel Security, announced their collaboration to fight ransomware.

paragraph 15 is :<br>
 Attacker benefits The abuse of reputable applications affords attackers a number of benefits. Payloads are concealed behind a recognizable brand, contributing to the impression of legitimacy and helping ensure targeted users take the bait. This brand recognition continues after a system has been compromised, through recognizable directory, file, process, and registry key names and attributes. These elements can provide cover during security scans and forensics analysis, with recognizable properties blending with hundreds or even thousands of familiar programs.<br>
paragraph 16 is :<br>
 The idea of riding on the coattails of popular applications harkens to the early days of malware creation, arguably with the inception decades ago of the very first parasitic file-infecting virus. Viruses differ from Trojans in that they recursively self-replicate, meaning that they spread to other files, those files in turn spread to other files, and so on. Part of the threat is the replication logic, which decides the files to target and where to insert malicious routines. Viruses can be analyzed and reverse engineered, and the replication logic and markers provide an additional detection surface for antivirus software. Parasitic Trojans, on the other hand, do not self-replicate, allowing for inserted code to be streamlined toward the desired payload without the additional overhead and corresponding detection surface. This can be an Achilles heel for defenses that are ill equipped to cope with such attacks.<br>
paragraph 17 is :<br>
 Binders/Joiners Binder programs first appeared in the 1990s and give malware distributors a quick and easy way to bundle their threats with other programs, documents, and multimedia files. Decoupling the malicious code from any social engineering aspects of an attack affords the perpetrators the benefit of customizing each binary for a given campaign, without having to code or recompile a threat. All that is required to build a new customized threat is to select current malware and accompanying files. The binder will combine all of them into a new executable ready for distribution. When a victim runs the program, both the malware and combined file will be run. Although binders do bundle clean and dirty files together, the result is a new piece of malware, which does not closely resemble a legitimate file.<br>

 Client-side patching. Similarly, tools can run on the endpoint to patch local files.<br>
paragraph 19 is :<br>
 BackDoor Factory (BDF) is a popular open-source executable binary patcher that supports Windows, Mac, and Linux binary patching. Target programs are modified to include predefined or user-specified shellcode. BDF allows the operator to specify many options, including the host IP, port, and where to insert the shellcode within the target. Code can be placed in the slack space of a program and spread over one or more cavities, thus maintaining the original file size and executable geometry. This tactic may render certain feature vectors ineffective in machine learning algorithms applied to such threats.<br>
paragraph 20 is :<br>
 The Backdoor Factory Proxy (BDFProxy) takes BDF a step further by patching executables on the fly as they are downloaded, leveraging a man-in-the- middle attack posture. Joshua Pitts, the author of the BDF tools, discovered this approach was actively being used in the wild in 2014 when applications were downloaded via a Tor exit node in Russia. This discovery was made within about an hour after the beginning of his search. In particular, all uncompressed Windows executable files served over nonsecured HTTP connections were modified to include the OnionDuke malware.<br>

In 2015 and the first half of 2016, the Angler exploit kit was the most popular mechanism for delivering ransomware to potential victims. These exploit kits are popular and have a strong support system. However, in April and May, the volume of Angler traffic dropped dramatically, eventually shutting down completely. It appeared to have been replaced in popularity by Neutrino, although at nowhere near Angler’s volume of traffic. Another shift in exploit kits happened in September, with RIG rising to challenge Neutrino for top spot. Whatever is driving these changes in the ransomware delivery marketplace, expect continued variations as attackers look for new ways to evade defenses.<br>

 Generally speaking, ransomware attacks began in the 1990s as seemingly random campaigns, with broad delivery mechanisms used to catch the There has been a significant occasional consumer. In the past year, we have seen a significant shift to business shift by ransomware attackers targets, as a few successful campaigns have encouraged more attacks. Typical to business targets, as a few targets include essential services such as hospitals, but also small and medium- successful campaigns have encouraged more attacks. sized businesses, which often lack a fully staffed cybersecurity operation. The initial attack vector for many of these campaigns is targeted phishing emails aimed at a specific individual or job function. In addition to encrypting files, the malware captures user credentials to steal data or spread the infection throughout the organization.<br>

Mamba also adapted the previously described anti–virtual machine technique, using a password as a command-line argument to execute the malware.<br>

 Ransomware-as-a-service providers recently introduced the concept of bridges, which are PHP scripts that connect attackers with their victims. The script uses itself as a database and stores client keys, operating systems, IP addresses, and ransom amounts, verifies the status of payments and delivers victims’ information to the main servers. Bridges are password protected and avoid detection by search engines.<br>

 ransomware attacks begin with phishing emails, user awareness is critically important. For every 10 emails sent by attackers, statistics have shown that at least one will be successful. Do not open emails or attachments from unverified or unknown senders.<br>

 Most malicious applications today are rotten to the core. They serve one purpose, to profit bad actors, subjecting their victims to attacks. The tactical We see a trend toward objectives of such crimes are generally to reach the target, establish a presence, “Trojanizing” legitimate and persist for an extended time. To reach their targets, attackers either draw applications, which are injected victims in through social engineering or intercept their everyday computer with malicious nonreplicating code. usage, most often through exploitation. In either case, the goal is for those unfortunate enough to cross paths with malicious code to be none the wiser. The longer attacks can go unnoticed, the larger the payout. To this end, attackers are growing more sophisticated as they endeavor to create long lasting, fully undetectable creations. The more authentic-looking a piece of code, the more likely it is to be overlooked. This is the primary driving factor in an increasing trend of “Trojanizing” legitimate applications, which are injected with malicious nonreplicating code.<br>
paragraph 14 is :<br>
 Attacker benefits The abuse of reputable applications affords attackers a number of benefits. Payloads are concealed behind a recognizable brand, contributing to the impression of legitimacy and helping ensure targeted users take the bait. This brand recognition continues after a system has been compromised, through recognizable directory, file, process, and registry key names and attributes. These elements can provide cover during security scans and forensics analysis, with recognizable properties blending with hundreds or even thousands of familiar programs.<br>

 In last year’s McAfee Labs 2016 Threats Predictions Report, we claimed that 2015’s spike in ransomware attacks would continue and that ransomware Not a day went by in 2016 in would be a major and rapidly growing threat in 2016. As predicted, 2016 may which ransomware did not make be remembered as “the year of ransomware,” with both a huge jump in the security industry headlines. number of ransomware attacks and significant technical advances in this type In this Key Topic, we highlight 2016’s many significant technical of attack. Through the end of Q3, the number of new ransomware samples enhancements in ransomware and this year totals 3,860,603, an increase of 80% since the beginning of the the progress the security industry year. Some of 2016’s most significant technical advancements in ransomware is making to fight back against the include partial or full disk encryption, encryption of websites used by threat. legitimate applications, anti-sandboxing, more sophisticated exploit kits for ransomware delivery, and ransomware-as-a-service. This Key Topic discusses these advancements and also some good news, including the newly formed anti-ransomware collaboration No More Ransom! and several successful ransomware control system takedowns.<br>

 Most of these organizations consider themselves to be similar to their peers in information security investments and speed of adoption of new security capabilities. However, around 30% think that they are above average in investment or technology adoption, and only about 10% think they are below average.<br>
paragraph 6 is :<br>
Methods to address these goals include the three pillars of people, processes, and technology. Of the organizations that do not yet have all four types of security teams operating, 40% plan to deploy internal people into those roles within 12 to 18 months. Similarly, around 40% of organizations plan to increase their use of MSSP people within one or more of these security functions in that period. Deploying new security technology is another way to enhance capabilities, with more than 60% of organizations planning to invest in tools for these teams. Given the significant percentage of organizations that are not managing to triage and investigate all of their alerts, it is not surprising that key processes are the top two focus areas for new tools: improving the speed and accuracy of initial triage and prioritization of security alerts, and reducing the time and effort it takes to conduct incident investigations.<br>
paragraph 7 is :<br>
 Three major investment priorities During the next 12 to 18 months, organizations plan to invest in three major areas to improve their capabilities: responsiveness, detection, and investigation. Methods of improvement vary by country, organization size, and other attributes. These appear to be dependent on the availability of local resources, whether skilled security personnel, new and enhanced tools, or capable MSSPs.<br>

 This year, ransomware found a new and vulnerable target: hospitals. Although there was some criticism from the hacker community about these attacks, many of the victims paid, fueling further incidents. There was no real technical evolution in these attacks, just phishing emails targeting people using essential systems. However, the rest of the year saw considerable technical advances, including partial and full disk encryption, variable and increasing ransom demands, and new ransomware delivery mechanisms.<br>

 Binders/Joiners Binder programs first appeared in the 1990s and give malware distributors a quick and easy way to bundle their threats with other programs, documents, and multimedia files. Decoupling the malicious code from any social engineering aspects of an attack affords the perpetrators the benefit of customizing each binary for a given campaign, without having to code or recompile a threat. All that is required to build a new customized threat is to select current malware and accompanying files. The binder will combine all of them into a new executable ready for distribution. When a victim runs the program, both the malware and combined file will be run. Although binders do bundle clean and dirty files together, the result is a new piece of malware, which does not closely resemble a legitimate file.<br>

 These attack scenarios apply to the majority of Internet users. Even those who seldom install new applications are likely to have existing applications configured for autoupdates. It is still commonplace for update servers to deliver binaries over insecure HTTP connections. Connecting to open Wi-Fi hotspots provides others an opportunity to carry out man-in-the-middle attacks. Running untrusted programs remains a significant attack vector, and the ever-growing use of shared libraries increases the overall risk, especially as it pertains to mobile devices and the Internet of Things.<br>

Later that year we also saw an increase in the threat of exposure of sensitive files and trashing the operating system, in addition to encrypting the victim’s data.<br>
paragraph 5 is :<br>
 Petya also brought on increasing ransom demands, doubling the amount if payment was not made within seven days. One ransomware variant threatened to delete one file per hour until the ransom was paid. Another encoded a series of ransom amounts, which it chose based on the name of the distribution file, making it quick and easy to make the demand fit the victim’s ability to pay. In another case, a hospital that paid the first ransom demand was then told to pay again if it wanted to regain access to all of the files. The hospital ignored the second demand, but it remains an ongoing concern that attackers will not be “honorable” in their actions and refuse to release encryption keys even after receiving payment.<br>

 More than 65% of organizations with SOCs have formal threat-hunting operations, especially in large enterprise organizations, in which it was reported by almost 75% of those surveyed. Commercial organizations tend more toward an ad-hoc approach, with 41% of them using this less formal method. Only 5% of organizations report no active threat hunting. Formal threat hunting shows a strong relationship with SOC models and maturity levels.

 The ability to quickly identify, investigate, and resolve threats is probably the most important aspect of today’s security operations. Preventing 100% of attacks may never be achievable, but security information and event management (SIEM) often provides a real-time understanding of the world outside—threat data, reputation feeds, and vulnerability status—as well as a view of the systems, users, data, risks, and activities inside, obtained through continuous monitoring and correlation. Actionable intelligence and situational awareness delivered by a SIEM may help orchestrate security operations and, when an incident is detected, may enable better collaboration for faster incident response.<br>

 Suspicious files are often sent to a “sandbox” for evaluation before being allowed to run on a user’s system. This year, ransomware attackers learned The common “sandbox” method how to differentiate between a sandbox, which is usually a virtual machine, used to detect ransomware can and a live human’s device. In a recent case, Locky, the culprit in many of now be detected and evaded by the hospital ransomware attacks, used encrypted code and execution time some ransomware. differences between real and virtual machines to evade detection. Two API calls, GetProcessHeap() and CloseHandle(), one of which should be about 10 times faster on a real system, are run by the malware, which goes dormant if the execution time difference is not as large as expected.<br>

 Generally speaking, ransomware attacks began in the 1990s as seemingly random campaigns, with broad delivery mechanisms used to catch the There has been a significant occasional consumer. In the past year, we have seen a significant shift to business shift by ransomware attackers targets, as a few successful campaigns have encouraged more attacks. Typical to business targets, as a few targets include essential services such as hospitals, but also small and medium- successful campaigns have encouraged more attacks. sized businesses, which often lack a fully staffed cybersecurity operation. The initial attack vector for many of these campaigns is targeted phishing emails aimed at a specific individual or job function. In addition to encrypting files, the malware captures user credentials to steal data or spread the infection throughout the organization.<br>

 ransomware attacks begin with phishing emails, user awareness is critically important. For every 10 emails sent by attackers, statistics have shown that at least one will be successful. Do not open emails or attachments from unverified or unknown senders.<br>

 Attacker benefits The abuse of reputable applications affords attackers a number of benefits. Payloads are concealed behind a recognizable brand, contributing to the impression of legitimacy and helping ensure targeted users take the bait. This brand recognition continues after a system has been compromised, through recognizable directory, file, process, and registry key names and attributes. These elements can provide cover during security scans and forensics analysis, with recognizable properties blending with hundreds or even thousands of familiar programs.<br>

 BackDoor Factory (BDF) is a popular open-source executable binary patcher that supports Windows, Mac, and Linux binary patching. Target programs are modified to include predefined or user-specified shellcode. BDF allows the operator to specify many options, including the host IP, port, and where to insert the shellcode within the target. Code can be placed in the slack space of a program and spread over one or more cavities, thus maintaining the original file size and executable geometry. This tactic may render certain feature vectors ineffective in machine learning algorithms applied to such threats.<br>

 These attack scenarios apply to the majority of Internet users. Even those who seldom install new applications are likely to have existing applications configured for autoupdates. It is still commonplace for update servers to deliver binaries over insecure HTTP connections. Connecting to open Wi-Fi hotspots provides others an opportunity to carry out man-in-the-middle attacks. Running untrusted programs remains a significant attack vector, and the ever-growing use of shared libraries increases the overall risk, especially as it pertains to mobile devices and the Internet of Things.<br>

 Next, shift the emphasis to time to detection, containment, and remediation. These times are the most effective way to focus attention and resources where they are most needed. Reducing these security times usually requires a combination of integration, automation, and improving workflows.

 “Trojanized” legitimate software is on the rise —Craig Schmugar<br>
paragraph 8 is :<br>
 Earlier this year, the Internet blew up over the topic of whether Apple should assist the FBI by providing access to a deceased terrorist’s iPhone. Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, referred to government’s demands as asking for the “equivalent of a master key, capable of opening hundreds of millions of locks.” In the end, the FBI gained access through undisclosed means and withdrew the request, but the notion of backdoor access is something that has been coveted by malware authors, spies, and nation-states for decades. Tactics for accomplishing this goal range from persuading victims via social engineering to hand over the keys to their devices, to intercepting hardware in the supply chain and inserting backdoors to surreptitiously gain remote access. However, the most common method is through the deployment of Trojan software.<br>
paragraph 9 is :<br>
 Another benefit is built-in persistence, or a method of restarting code that was previously terminated. Malware persistence falls into one of two categories: self- persistence, involving the installation of start-up hooks to endure reboots; and companion-persistence, which leverages existing start-up hooks to automatically load before, during, or after other wanted applications. Each system change made by malicious code is an indicator of compromise. Thus the fewer the number of changes, the smaller the detection surface. Trojanizing legitimate applications provides free persistence; the software’s natural method of start-up is all that is necessary for the malicious code to load. In fact, if the program is run manually on a regular basis, then persistence is self-perpetuated by the victims themselves.<br>
paragraph 10 is :<br>
 The idea of riding on the coattails of popular applications harkens to the early days of malware creation, arguably with the inception decades ago of the very first parasitic file-infecting virus. Viruses differ from Trojans in that they recursively self-replicate, meaning that they spread to other files, those files in turn spread to other files, and so on. Part of the threat is the replication logic, which decides the files to target and where to insert malicious routines. Viruses can be analyzed and reverse engineered, and the replication logic and markers provide an additional detection surface for antivirus software. Parasitic Trojans, on the other hand, do not self-replicate, allowing for inserted code to be streamlined toward the desired payload without the additional overhead and corresponding detection surface. This can be an Achilles heel for defenses that are ill equipped to cope with such attacks.<br>

 Ransomware dates to 1989, when 20,000 infected floppy disks were distributed at the World Health Organization’s AIDS conference. Using symmetric encryption, this attack was quickly broken. The first asymmetric encryption implemented in a cryptovirus attack was published in Adam Young’s 1995 master’s thesis: “Cryptovirology and the Dark Side of Black Box Cryptography.” The size of the virus was a little less than 7KB. It was not until the mid-2000s that asymmetric encryption, which is much more difficult to decipher, was used in a ransomware attack.<br>

 Security operations appear to be maturing, with sophisticated tools and well- staffed teams augmented by external resources. However, they are not keeping up with the volume of alerts and incidents, putting them at significant risk of a moderate or severe breach. What are their plans for enhancing their capabilities?<br>
paragraph 3 is :<br>
Methods to address these goals include the three pillars of people, processes, and technology. Of the organizations that do not yet have all four types of security teams operating, 40% plan to deploy internal people into those roles within 12 to 18 months. Similarly, around 40% of organizations plan to increase their use of MSSP people within one or more of these security functions in that period. Deploying new security technology is another way to enhance capabilities, with more than 60% of organizations planning to invest in tools for these teams. Given the significant percentage of organizations that are not managing to triage and investigate all of their alerts, it is not surprising that key processes are the top two focus areas for new tools: improving the speed and accuracy of initial triage and prioritization of security alerts, and reducing the time and effort it takes to conduct incident investigations.<br>
paragraph 4 is :<br>
 Upgraded tools and capabilities still needed Although SOCs have become more common, most organizations are still overwhelmed with alerts and are unable to properly investigate one out of four, resulting in minor or moderate business impacts. As a result, most feel it is important to continue making improvements to their internal security capabilities, continue or increase their use of MSSPs, and invest in additional or enhanced tools.<br>
paragraph 5 is :<br>
 Three major investment priorities During the next 12 to 18 months, organizations plan to invest in three major areas to improve their capabilities: responsiveness, detection, and investigation. Methods of improvement vary by country, organization size, and other attributes. These appear to be dependent on the availability of local resources, whether skilled security personnel, new and enhanced tools, or capable MSSPs.<br>

 Ransomware-as-a-service providers recently introduced the concept of bridges, which are PHP scripts that connect attackers with their victims. The script uses itself as a database and stores client keys, operating systems, IP addresses, and ransom amounts, verifies the status of payments and delivers victims’ information to the main servers. Bridges are password protected and avoid detection by search engines.<br>

 The idea of riding on the coattails of popular applications harkens to the early days of malware creation, arguably with the inception decades ago of the very first parasitic file-infecting virus. Viruses differ from Trojans in that they recursively self-replicate, meaning that they spread to other files, those files in turn spread to other files, and so on. Part of the threat is the replication logic, which decides the files to target and where to insert malicious routines. Viruses can be analyzed and reverse engineered, and the replication logic and markers provide an additional detection surface for antivirus software. Parasitic Trojans, on the other hand, do not self-replicate, allowing for inserted code to be streamlined toward the desired payload without the additional overhead and corresponding detection surface. This can be an Achilles heel for defenses that are ill equipped to cope with such attacks.<br>

 These attack scenarios apply to the majority of Internet users. Even those who seldom install new applications are likely to have existing applications configured for autoupdates. It is still commonplace for update servers to deliver binaries over insecure HTTP connections. Connecting to open Wi-Fi hotspots provides others an opportunity to carry out man-in-the-middle attacks. Running untrusted programs remains a significant attack vector, and the ever-growing use of shared libraries increases the overall risk, especially as it pertains to mobile devices and the Internet of Things.<br>

 For the next 12 to 18 months, most organizations (71%) expect their MSSP use to remain the same, while 19% expect it to increase and 10% expect it to decrease. Those that expect MSSP use to decrease are bringing more security operations in house to improve incident response and the quality of investigations. Those that expect it to increase are looking to external partners to improve investigations and scoping of potential incidents, and broaden security monitoring and monitoring coverage. Basically, choosing internal or external resources for security operations is most likely dependent on the availability of internal personnel, external services, and the comparative skill levels. As a result, there is some variance by country, with German organizations primarily interested in improving advanced threat detection with MSSPs, and UK outfits looking for help with technology such as big data platforms, analytics, and threat intelligence.<br>

 The ability to quickly identify, investigate, and resolve threats is probably the most important aspect of today’s security operations. Preventing 100% of attacks may never be achievable, but security information and event management (SIEM) often provides a real-time understanding of the world outside—threat data, reputation feeds, and vulnerability status—as well as a view of the systems, users, data, risks, and activities inside, obtained through continuous monitoring and correlation.

Methods to address these goals include the three pillars of people, processes, and technology. Of the organizations that do not yet have all four types of security teams operating, 40% plan to deploy internal people into those roles within 12 to 18 months. Similarly, around 40% of organizations plan to increase their use of MSSP people within one or more of these security functions in that period. Deploying new security technology is another way to enhance capabilities, with more than 60% of organizations planning to invest in tools for these teams. Given the significant percentage of organizations that are not managing to triage and investigate all of their alerts, it is not surprising that key processes are the top two focus areas for new tools: improving the speed and accuracy of initial triage and prioritization of security alerts, and reducing the time and effort it takes to conduct incident investigations.<br>

Security analytics is of growing interest to help address the volume of alerts, and is already in use by 67% of these organizations.

 Petya also brought on increasing ransom demands, doubling the amount if payment was not made within seven days. One ransomware variant threatened to delete one file per hour until the ransom was paid. Another encoded a series of ransom amounts, which it chose based on the name of the distribution file, making it quick and easy to make the demand fit the victim’s ability to pay. In another case, a hospital that paid the first ransom demand was then told to pay again if it wanted to regain access to all of the files. The hospital ignored the second demand, but it remains an ongoing concern that attackers will not be “honorable” in their actions and refuse to release encryption keys even after receiving payment.<br>

 In March, the ransomware family KimcilWare appeared. The ransomware does not attack the victims’ machines but instead targets websites that use Magento ecommerce store files. By encrypting the files with a Rijndael (AES) block cipher and appending the extension .kimcilware at the end of each file, the store’s files become useless.

 Suspicious files are often sent to a “sandbox” for evaluation before being allowed to run on a user’s system. This year, ransomware attackers learned The common “sandbox” method how to differentiate between a sandbox, which is usually a virtual machine, used to detect ransomware can and a live human’s device. In a recent case, Locky, the culprit in many of now be detected and evaded by the hospital ransomware attacks, used encrypted code and execution time some ransomware. differences between real and virtual machines to evade detection. Two API calls, GetProcessHeap() and CloseHandle(), one of which should be about 10 times faster on a real system, are run by the malware, which goes dormant if the execution time difference is not as large as expected.<br>

 At the same time, the command-line argument “123” is used to execute the ransomware. Sandboxes in general execute the malware without any arguments. By not having the right argument, the ransomware will terminate and cannot be fully analyzed by the sandbox technology. Share this Report<br>

In the past year, we have seen a significant shift to business shift by ransomware attackers targets, as a few successful campaigns have encouraged more attacks. Typical to business targets, as a few targets include essential services such as hospitals, but also small and medium- successful campaigns have encouraged more attacks. sized businesses, which often lack a fully staffed cybersecurity operation. The initial attack vector for many of these campaigns is targeted phishing emails aimed at a specific individual or job function. In addition to encrypting files, the malware captures user credentials to steal data or spread the infection throughout the organization.<br>

Not only complete disk partitions. does this encryption make a partition’s files inaccessible, it also prevents the operating system from booting, requiring victims to use another machine to contact the attacker for payment and recovery instructions. Mamba also adapted the previously described anti–virtual machine technique, using a password as a command-line argument to execute the malware.<br>

 Ransomware-as-a-service providers recently introduced the concept of bridges, which are PHP scripts that connect attackers with their victims. The script uses itself as a database and stores client keys, operating systems, IP addresses, and ransom amounts, verifies the status of payments and delivers victims’ information to the main servers. Bridges are password protected and avoid detection by search engines.<br>

paragraph 36 is :<br>
 Attacker benefits The abuse of reputable applications affords attackers a number of benefits. Payloads are concealed behind a recognizable brand, contributing to the impression of legitimacy and helping ensure targeted users take the bait. This brand recognition continues after a system has been compromised, through recognizable directory, file, process, and registry key names and attributes. These elements can provide cover during security scans and forensics analysis, with recognizable properties blending with hundreds or even thousands of familiar programs.<br>
paragraph 37 is :<br>
 The idea of riding on the coattails of popular applications harkens to the early days of malware creation, arguably with the inception decades ago of the very first parasitic file-infecting virus. Viruses differ from Trojans in that they recursively self-replicate, meaning that they spread to other files, those files in turn spread to other files, and so on. Part of the threat is the replication logic, which decides the files to target and where to insert malicious routines. Viruses can be analyzed and reverse engineered, and the replication logic and markers provide an additional detection surface for antivirus software. Parasitic Trojans, on the other hand, do not self-replicate, allowing for inserted code to be streamlined toward the desired payload without the additional overhead and corresponding detection surface. This can be an Achilles heel for defenses that are ill equipped to cope with such attacks.<br>

With the ability to add or modify code and configurations, or build scripts, dirty one may provide some cover attackers can impersonate software vendors and inherit the trust they have for those aiming to dupe users, but with their customers.

 Patchers Binary patching programs have emerged in the last couple of years to simplify the process of adding payloads to already compiled applications. Unlike Binary patching programs have binders, patchers modify executables rather than create new ones. Payloads are emerged in the last couple of strategically inserted with the goal of seamlessly maintaining application usage. years to simplify the process These tools can be used in three scenarios: attacker/server side, client side, or of adding malware payloads to already compiled applications. man in the middle.<br>

 Attacker- or server-side patching. Tools run locally or remotely to statically patch binaries, which can be used to replace their desired counterparts.<br>
paragraph 42 is :<br>
Regardless of the distribution approach, the binaries are modified to take the place of desired or known applications. Binary patching is perhaps most heavily used today in the realm of Android apps. Kits such as AndroRat and Dendroid are responsible for tens of thousands of copycat apps concealing malicious payloads.<br>
paragraph 43 is :<br>
 BackDoor Factory (BDF) is a popular open-source executable binary patcher that supports Windows, Mac, and Linux binary patching. Target programs are modified to include predefined or user-specified shellcode. BDF allows the operator to specify many options, including the host IP, port, and where to insert the shellcode within the target. Code can be placed in the slack space of a program and spread over one or more cavities, thus maintaining the original file size and executable geometry. This tactic may render certain feature vectors ineffective in machine learning algorithms applied to such threats.<br>
paragraph 44 is :<br>
 The Backdoor Factory Proxy (BDFProxy) takes BDF a step further by patching executables on the fly as they are downloaded, leveraging a man-in-the- middle attack posture. Joshua Pitts, the author of the BDF tools, discovered this approach was actively being used in the wild in 2014 when applications were downloaded via a Tor exit node in Russia. This discovery was made within about an hour after the beginning of his search. In particular, all uncompressed Windows executable files served over nonsecured HTTP connections were modified to include the OnionDuke malware.<br>
paragraph 45 is :<br>
 These attack scenarios apply to the majority of Internet users. Even those who seldom install new applications are likely to have existing applications configured for autoupdates. It is still commonplace for update servers to deliver binaries over insecure HTTP connections. Connecting to open Wi-Fi hotspots provides others an opportunity to carry out man-in-the-middle attacks. Running untrusted programs remains a significant attack vector, and the ever-growing use of shared libraries increases the overall risk, especially as it pertains to mobile devices and the Internet of Things.<br>
paragraph 46 is :<br>
 A VPN should be used when connecting to an untrusted network. Administrators should keep security software up to date and rely on strong indicators of trust rather than those potentially forged in an attack. Applications should be signed and verified with a chain of trust. Forensic analysis should include correlating hashes with trusted sources.<br>
paragraph 47 is :<br>
 Security software should include dynamic analysis to flag rogue actions regardless of initial binary inspection because static scanning goes only so far. Behavioral monitoring, web and IP reputation, memory scanning, and application containment are welcome components in a complete solution.<br>
paragraph 48 is :<br>
 Vendor downloads should occur over secure connections and all code should be signed. This drastically reduces man-in-the-middle attacks. Software vendors should include self-validation in their applications, regularly audit their code, use static code analysis tools, and perform peer reviews.<br>

 More than 65% of organizations with SOCs have formal threat-hunting operations, especially in large enterprise organizations, in which it was reported by almost 75% of those surveyed. Commercial organizations tend more toward an ad-hoc approach, with 41% of them using this less formal method. Only 5% of organizations report no active threat hunting. Formal threat hunting shows a strong relationship with SOC models and maturity levels. A bit more than 60% of organizations running virtual, co-managed, or multifunction SOCs have formal threat hunting, compared with more than 70% of those with dedicated or command SOCs.<br>
paragraph 4 is :<br>
Advancing the maturity level of a SOC involves three design principles. First, objectively evaluate the current level of organization maturity. What are the team’s strengths and weaknesses, where are the gaps, and what is the risk posture? As part of this, identify the metrics necessary for ongoing evaluation, and the data necessary to calculate them.<br>

 Ransomware dates to 1989, when 20,000 infected floppy disks were distributed at the World Health Organization’s AIDS conference. Using symmetric encryption, this attack was quickly broken. The first asymmetric encryption implemented in a cryptovirus attack was published in Adam Young’s 1995 master’s thesis: “Cryptovirology and the Dark Side of Black Box Cryptography.” The size of the virus was a little less than 7KB. It was not until the mid-2000s that asymmetric encryption, which is much more difficult to decipher, was used in a ransomware attack.<br>
paragraph 6 is :<br>
 In March, the ransomware family KimcilWare appeared. The ransomware does not attack the victims’ machines but instead targets websites that use Magento ecommerce store files. By encrypting the files with a Rijndael (AES) block cipher and appending the extension .kimcilware at the end of each file, the store’s files become useless. The attacker can be contacted on a Hotmail account and after paying US$140 in Bitcoins, the attacker hands over a decryption key to the victim.<br>

 When cybercriminals do not have technical skills, infrastructure, or time, they can now participate and set up their own ransomware campaigns and extort money “Ransomware-as-a-service” has from victims within hours. This is the aim of “ransomware-as-a-service.” The emerged: Attackers buy access infrastructure is set up by a criminal service provider.

Methods to address these goals include the three pillars of people, processes, and technology. Of the organizations that do not yet have all four types of security teams operating, 40% plan to deploy internal people into those roles within 12 to 18 months. Similarly, around 40% of organizations plan to increase their use of MSSP people within one or more of these security functions in that period. Deploying new security technology is another way to enhance capabilities, with more than 60% of organizations planning to invest in tools for these teams. Given the significant percentage of organizations that are not managing to triage and investigate all of their alerts, it is not surprising that key processes are the top two focus areas for new tools: improving the speed and accuracy of initial triage and prioritization of security alerts, and reducing the time and effort it takes to conduct incident investigations.<br>

Security analytics is of growing interest to help address the volume of alerts, and is already in use by 67% of these organizations.

Smaller organizations in general are implementing SOCs a bit later than enterprises, as only 44% of commercial groups have had one for more than 12 months, whereas 56% of enterprise SOCs have been around for that long. Most SOCs (60%) are currently run internally, with 23% operating a mix of internal and external support, and 17% fully external. For the few that have not established a SOC, only 2% of enterprises have no plans to do so, versus 7% of commercial companies.<br>

paragraph 21 is :<br>
 Only 7% overall indicate that incidents have decreased, and the remaining 25% say that they have remained stable over the past year. There was little variance reported by country, but incidents increased as organizations get smaller, possibly indicating that criminals have broadened their attack targets. Only 45% of the largest organizations (more than 20,000 employees) reported an increase, compared with 73% of the smallest (fewer than 5,000 employees).<br>

 The ability to quickly identify, investigate, and resolve threats is probably the most important aspect of today’s security operations. Preventing 100% of attacks may never be achievable, but security information and event management (SIEM) often provides a real-time understanding of the world outside—threat data, reputation feeds, and vulnerability status—as well as a view of the systems, users, data, risks, and activities inside, obtained through continuous monitoring and correlation. Actionable intelligence and situational awareness delivered by a SIEM may help orchestrate security operations and, when an incident is detected, may enable better collaboration for faster incident response.<br>

 Almost 70% of these organizations report using a SIEM solution today. Those organizations using external security services are highly likely (93%) to have those services involved with the SIEM in some fashion, most of them (71%) asking the MSSP to run day-to-day SIEM operations. Almost half (45%) of companies without a SIEM intend to deploy the functionality within the next 12 to 18 months.<br>

 SOCs are back and continuing to expand SOCs have returned from movie land and become critical components of an organization’s security posture. Data breaches are on the rise, whether from increased attacks or better detection, and SOCs can help security teams triage alerts, respond to incidents, coordinate investigations, and proactively hunt for threats. There is no perfect SOC model. Whether the SOC is internal or external, dedicated or multifunction, the important thing is to continue improving security operations, from reactive to proactive and optimized.<br>

 Upgraded tools and capabilities still needed Although SOCs have become more common, most organizations are still overwhelmed with alerts and are unable to properly investigate one out of four, resulting in minor or moderate business impacts.

In 2015 and the first half of 2016, the Angler exploit kit was the most popular mechanism for delivering ransomware to potential victims. These exploit kits are popular and have a strong support system. However, in April and May, the volume of Angler traffic dropped dramatically, eventually shutting down completely. It appeared to have been replaced in popularity by Neutrino, although at nowhere near Angler’s volume of traffic. Another shift in exploit kits happened in September, with RIG rising to challenge Neutrino for top spot. Whatever is driving these changes in the ransomware delivery marketplace, expect continued variations as attackers look for new ways to evade defenses.<br>

 BackDoor Factory (BDF) is a popular open-source executable binary patcher that supports Windows, Mac, and Linux binary patching. Target programs are modified to include predefined or user-specified shellcode. BDF allows the operator to specify many options, including the host IP, port, and where to insert the shellcode within the target. Code can be placed in the slack space of a program and spread over one or more cavities, thus maintaining the original file size and executable geometry. This tactic may render certain feature vectors ineffective in machine learning algorithms applied to such threats.<br>

 Binders/Joiners Binder programs first appeared in the 1990s and give malware distributors a quick and easy way to bundle their threats with other programs, documents, and multimedia files. Decoupling the malicious code from any social engineering aspects of an attack affords the perpetrators the benefit of customizing each binary for a given campaign, without having to code or recompile a threat. All that is required to build a new customized threat is to select current malware and accompanying files. The binder will combine all of them into a new executable ready for distribution. When a victim runs the program, both the malware and combined file will be run. Although binders do bundle clean and dirty files together, the result is a new piece of malware, which does not closely resemble a legitimate file.<br>

If you were not in the defense department or on Wall Street, many thought, then you did not need a SOC. Then targeted attacks and insider threats moved from movie and government plots to an everyday reality for enterprises. According to an Intel Security survey, 68% of investigations in 2015 involved a specific entity, either as a targeted external attack or an insider threat.<br>

 The majority of organizations (55%) reported that firewall logs are the primary source used for advanced threat detection and investigation, followed by endpoint logs (34%) and system logs (32%). Other data, such as logs from VPN activity, web proxies, DNS, and DHCP servers are used by 20% or less. Historical data, important for forensic investigations or historical correlation, is typically retained for between 45 and 60 days. Firewall logs, endpoint threat detection logs, and Active Directory logs are retained for the longest period.<br>

 In March, the ransomware family KimcilWare appeared. The ransomware does not attack the victims’ machines but instead targets websites that use Magento ecommerce store files. By encrypting the files with a Rijndael (AES) block cipher and appending the extension .kimcilware at the end of each file, the store’s files become useless. The attacker can be contacted on a Hotmail account and after paying US$140 in Bitcoins, the attacker hands over a decryption key to the victim.<br>

 For the next 12 to 18 months, most organizations (71%) expect their MSSP use to remain the same, while 19% expect it to increase and 10% expect it to decrease. Those that expect MSSP use to decrease are bringing more security operations in house to improve incident response and the quality of investigations. Those that expect it to increase are looking to external partners to improve investigations and scoping of potential incidents, and broaden security monitoring and monitoring coverage. Basically, choosing internal or external resources for security operations is most likely dependent on the availability of internal personnel, external services, and the comparative skill levels. As a result, there is some variance by country, with German organizations primarily interested in improving advanced threat detection with MSSPs, and UK outfits looking for help with technology such as big data platforms, analytics, and threat intelligence.<br>

Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, referred to government’s demands as asking for the “equivalent of a master key, capable of opening hundreds of millions of locks.” In the end, the FBI gained access through undisclosed means and withdrew the request, but the notion of backdoor access is something that has been coveted by malware authors, spies, and nation-states for decades.

If you were not in the defense department or on Wall Street, many thought, then you did not need a SOC. Then targeted attacks and insider threats moved from movie and government plots to an everyday reality for enterprises. According to an Intel Security survey, 68% of investigations in 2015 involved a specific entity, either as a targeted external attack or an insider threat.<br>

 Today, almost all commercial (1,000–5,000 employees) and enterprise (more than 5,000 employees) organizations run some type of SOC, and half of them have Almost all commercial and had one for more than a year, according to the latest research study from Intel enterprise organizations run some Security. As the number of incidents continues to increase, security organizations type of SOC. They are investing appear to be maturing and using what they learn to educate and improve more in SOCs and many have seen a decline in incident investigations. prevention in a virtuous cycle. For instance, survey respondents documented They attribute the decline to their expanding investments in SOCs and attributed an increase in investigations better protection and processes. to an improved ability to detect attacks. Those who reported a decline in investigations of incidents attributed this improvement to better protection and processes, which mature organizations perform as the final stage of a security investigation.<br>
paragraph 12 is :<br>
 Almost nine out of 10 organizations in this study reported that they have an internal or external SOC, although commercial organizations are slightly less likely to have one (84%) compared with enterprises (91%). Smaller organizations in general are implementing SOCs a bit later than enterprises, as only 44% of commercial groups have had one for more than 12 months, whereas 56% of enterprise SOCs have been around for that long. Most SOCs (60%) are currently run internally, with 23% operating a mix of internal and external support, and 17% fully external. For the few that have not established a SOC, only 2% of enterprises have no plans to do so, versus 7% of commercial companies.<br>

Whether from an increase in attacks or better monitoring capabilities, most companies (67%) reported an increase in security incidents, with 51% saying they have increased a little, and 16% that they have increased a lot. This is analogous to findings from the key topic “Information theft: the who, how, and prevention of data leakage” in the McAfee Labs Threats Report: September 2016.

paragraph 18 is :<br>
 Only 7% overall indicate that incidents have decreased, and the remaining 25% say that they have remained stable over the past year. There was little variance reported by country, but incidents increased as organizations get smaller, possibly indicating that criminals have broadened their attack targets. Only 45% of the largest organizations (more than 20,000 employees) reported an increase, compared with 73% of the smallest (fewer than 5,000 employees).<br>
paragraph 19 is :<br>
 The small group that reported a decrease in incidents overwhelmingly (96%) believe that this was due to better prevention and processes. Of those who said that incidents increased, the majority feel that it was due to a combination of improved detection capabilities (73%) and more attacks (57%).<br>

 Almost 70% of these organizations report using a SIEM solution today. Those organizations using external security services are highly likely (93%) to have those services involved with the SIEM in some fashion, most of them (71%) asking the MSSP to run day-to-day SIEM operations. Almost half (45%) of companies without a SIEM intend to deploy the functionality within the next 12 to 18 months.<br>

 More than 65% of organizations with SOCs have formal threat-hunting operations, especially in large enterprise organizations, in which it was reported by almost 75% of those surveyed. Commercial organizations tend more toward an ad-hoc approach, with 41% of them using this less formal method. Only 5% of organizations report no active threat hunting. Formal threat hunting shows a strong relationship with SOC models and maturity levels. A bit more than 60% of organizations running virtual, co-managed, or multifunction SOCs have formal threat hunting, compared with more than 70% of those with dedicated or command SOCs.<br>

 In the McAfee Labs 2016 Threats Predictions report, published last autumn, we claimed that 2015’s spike in ransomware attacks would continue and that ransomware would be a major and rapidly growing threat in 2016. As predicted, 2016 may be remembered as “the year of ransomware,” with both a huge jump in the number of ransomware attacks and significant technical advances in this type of attack.<br>
paragraph 30 is :<br>
 Ransomware dates to 1989, when 20,000 infected floppy disks were distributed at the World Health Organization’s AIDS conference. Using symmetric encryption, this attack was quickly broken. The first asymmetric encryption implemented in a cryptovirus attack was published in Adam Young’s 1995 master’s thesis: “Cryptovirology and the Dark Side of Black Box Cryptography.” The size of the virus was a little less than 7KB. It was not until the mid-2000s that asymmetric encryption, which is much more difficult to decipher, was used in a ransomware attack.<br>

In 2015 and the first half of 2016, the Angler exploit kit was the most popular mechanism for delivering ransomware to potential victims. These exploit kits are popular and have a strong support system. However, in April and May, the volume of Angler traffic dropped dramatically, eventually shutting down completely. It appeared to have been replaced in popularity by Neutrino, although at nowhere near Angler’s volume of traffic. Another shift in exploit kits happened in September, with RIG rising to challenge Neutrino for top spot. Whatever is driving these changes in the ransomware delivery marketplace, expect continued variations as attackers look for new ways to evade defenses.<br>

 In March we saw the appearance of Petya and partial disk encryption instead of file encryption. This ransomware is often delivered via a fake job-applicant email In March we saw the appearance with a Dropbox link, and begins the attack by overwriting the master boot record, partial disk encryption instead rebooting, and executing the malware, putting up a fake CHKDSK screen that of file encryption. This type of encrypts the master file table. While the files are still on the disk and unaffected, ransomware encrypts the master file table, making files inaccessible. the encrypted file table prevents them from being located. Paying the ransom gets the decryption key, which unlocks the file table and boot record, and removes the malware boot loader.<br>

 Suspicious files are often sent to a “sandbox” for evaluation before being allowed to run on a user’s system. This year, ransomware attackers learned The common “sandbox” method how to differentiate between a sandbox, which is usually a virtual machine, used to detect ransomware can and a live human’s device. In a recent case, Locky, the culprit in many of now be detected and evaded by the hospital ransomware attacks, used encrypted code and execution time some ransomware. differences between real and virtual machines to evade detection. Two API calls, GetProcessHeap() and CloseHandle(), one of which should be about 10 times faster on a real system, are run by the malware, which goes dormant if the execution time difference is not as large as expected.<br>

 At the same time, the command-line argument “123” is used to execute the ransomware. Sandboxes in general execute the malware without any arguments. By not having the right argument, the ransomware will terminate and cannot be fully analyzed by the sandbox technology. Share this Report<br>

 Generally speaking, ransomware attacks began in the 1990s as seemingly random campaigns, with broad delivery mechanisms used to catch the There has been a significant occasional consumer. In the past year, we have seen a significant shift to business shift by ransomware attackers targets, as a few successful campaigns have encouraged more attacks. Typical to business targets, as a few targets include essential services such as hospitals, but also small and medium- successful campaigns have encouraged more attacks. sized businesses, which often lack a fully staffed cybersecurity operation. The initial attack vector for many of these campaigns is targeted phishing emails aimed at a specific individual or job function. In addition to encrypting files, the malware captures user credentials to steal data or spread the infection throughout the organization.<br>

 Earlier this year, the Internet blew up over the topic of whether Apple should assist the FBI by providing access to a deceased terrorist’s iPhone. Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, referred to government’s demands as asking for the “equivalent of a master key, capable of opening hundreds of millions of locks.” In the end, the FBI gained access through undisclosed means and withdrew the request, but the notion of backdoor access is something that has been coveted by malware authors, spies, and nation-states for decades. Tactics for accomplishing this goal range from persuading victims via social engineering to hand over the keys to their devices, to intercepting hardware in the supply chain and inserting backdoors to surreptitiously gain remote access. However, the most common method is through the deployment of Trojan software.<br>
paragraph 12 is :<br>
 The idea of riding on the coattails of popular applications harkens to the early days of malware creation, arguably with the inception decades ago of the very first parasitic file-infecting virus. Viruses differ from Trojans in that they recursively self-replicate, meaning that they spread to other files, those files in turn spread to other files, and so on. Part of the threat is the replication logic, which decides the files to target and where to insert malicious routines. Viruses can be analyzed and reverse engineered, and the replication logic and markers provide an additional detection surface for antivirus software. Parasitic Trojans, on the other hand, do not self-replicate, allowing for inserted code to be streamlined toward the desired payload without the additional overhead and corresponding detection surface. This can be an Achilles heel for defenses that are ill equipped to cope with such attacks.<br>
paragraph 13 is :<br>
 Binders/Joiners Binder programs first appeared in the 1990s and give malware distributors a quick and easy way to bundle their threats with other programs, documents, and multimedia files. Decoupling the malicious code from any social engineering aspects of an attack affords the perpetrators the benefit of customizing each binary for a given campaign, without having to code or recompile a threat. All that is required to build a new customized threat is to select current malware and accompanying files. The binder will combine all of them into a new executable ready for distribution. When a victim runs the program, both the malware and combined file will be run. Although binders do bundle clean and dirty files together, the result is a new piece of malware, which does not closely resemble a legitimate file.<br>

 This ease is a prime factor in the rapid growth of Android malware, for which the creation of copycat apps is a regular occurrence. Last year, Lookout reported Trojanized adware masquerading as 20,000 popular apps. Our data shows this number has ballooned to nearly 700,000 in less than a year.<br>

 Patchers Binary patching programs have emerged in the last couple of years to simplify the process of adding payloads to already compiled applications. Unlike Binary patching programs have binders, patchers modify executables rather than create new ones. Payloads are emerged in the last couple of strategically inserted with the goal of seamlessly maintaining application usage. years to simplify the process These tools can be used in three scenarios: attacker/server side, client side, or of adding malware payloads to already compiled applications. man in the middle.<br>

 The Backdoor Factory Proxy (BDFProxy) takes BDF a step further by patching executables on the fly as they are downloaded, leveraging a man-in-the- middle attack posture. Joshua Pitts, the author of the BDF tools, discovered this approach was actively being used in the wild in 2014 when applications were downloaded via a Tor exit node in Russia. This discovery was made within about an hour after the beginning of his search. In particular, all uncompressed Windows executable files served over nonsecured HTTP connections were modified to include the OnionDuke malware.<br>

Common Word important :<br>
paragraph 1 is :<br>
 The ability to quickly identify, investigate, and resolve threats is probably the most important aspect of today’s security operations. Preventing 100% of attacks may never be achievable, but security information and event management (SIEM) often provides a real-time understanding of the world outside—threat data, reputation feeds, and vulnerability status—as well as a view of the systems, users, data, risks, and activities inside, obtained through continuous monitoring and correlation. Actionable intelligence and situational awareness delivered by a SIEM may help orchestrate security operations and, when an incident is detected, may enable better collaboration for faster incident response.<br>
paragraph 2 is :<br>
 The majority of organizations (55%) reported that firewall logs are the primary source used for advanced threat detection and investigation, followed by endpoint logs (34%) and system logs (32%). Other data, such as logs from VPN activity, web proxies, DNS, and DHCP servers are used by 20% or less. Historical data, important for forensic investigations or historical correlation, is typically retained for between 45 and 60 days. Firewall logs, endpoint threat detection logs, and Active Directory logs are retained for the longest period.<br>

paragraph 4 is :<br>
 SOCs are back and continuing to expand SOCs have returned from movie land and become critical components of an organization’s security posture. Data breaches are on the rise, whether from increased attacks or better detection, and SOCs can help security teams triage alerts, respond to incidents, coordinate investigations, and proactively hunt for threats. There is no perfect SOC model. Whether the SOC is internal or external, dedicated or multifunction, the important thing is to continue improving security operations, from reactive to proactive and optimized.<br>

 BackDoor Factory (BDF) is a popular open-source executable binary patcher that supports Windows, Mac, and Linux binary patching. Target programs are modified to include predefined or user-specified shellcode. BDF allows the operator to specify many options, including the host IP, port, and where to insert the shellcode within the target. Code can be placed in the slack space of a program and spread over one or more cavities, thus maintaining the original file size and executable geometry. This tactic may render certain feature vectors ineffective in machine learning algorithms applied to such threats.<br>

 Another benefit is built-in persistence, or a method of restarting code that was previously terminated. Malware persistence falls into one of two categories: self- persistence, involving the installation of start-up hooks to endure reboots; and companion-persistence, which leverages existing start-up hooks to automatically load before, during, or after other wanted applications. Each system change made by malicious code is an indicator of compromise. Thus the fewer the number of changes, the smaller the detection surface. Trojanizing legitimate applications provides free persistence; the software’s natural method of start-up is all that is necessary for the malicious code to load. In fact, if the program is run manually on a regular basis, then persistence is self-perpetuated by the victims themselves.<br>

If you were not in the defense department or on Wall Street, many thought, then you did not need a SOC. Then targeted attacks and insider threats moved from movie and government plots to an everyday reality for enterprises. According to an Intel Security survey, 68% of investigations in 2015 involved a specific entity, either as a targeted external attack or an insider threat.<br>

 This distribution of SOC implementations has several implications. The majority operate at or past the midpoint of SOC maturity, progressing toward the goal of a More than a quarter of surveyed proactive and optimized security operation. However, more than a quarter (26%) businesses still operate in reactive still operate in reactive mode, with ad-hoc approaches to security operations, mode, with ad-hoc approaches to threat hunting, and incident response. This can significantly extend detection security operations, threat hunting, and incident response. and response times, leaving the business at greater risk of significant damage, as well as facing a higher cleanup cost.<br>

 Most organizations receive some type of security operations assistance from managed security services providers, with 64% of those surveyed using MSSPs About two-thirds of organizations to augment their internal capabilities. Of the 26% that do not use external surveyed receive some type of services, Canadian organizations are the least likely to use one, at 40%.

Choosing internal or use MSSPs, the median work with two service providers. German organizations external resources for security are more likely to use three, and Canadian organizations only one. operations is most likely dependent on the availability of internal personnel, external services, and the comparative skill levels.<br>
paragraph 11 is :<br>
 For the next 12 to 18 months, most organizations (71%) expect their MSSP use to remain the same, while 19% expect it to increase and 10% expect it to decrease. Those that expect MSSP use to decrease are bringing more security operations in house to improve incident response and the quality of investigations. Those that expect it to increase are looking to external partners to improve investigations and scoping of potential incidents, and broaden security monitoring and monitoring coverage. Basically, choosing internal or external resources for security operations is most likely dependent on the availability of internal personnel, external services, and the comparative skill levels. As a result, there is some variance by country, with German organizations primarily interested in improving advanced threat detection with MSSPs, and UK outfits looking for help with technology such as big data platforms, analytics, and threat intelligence.<br>
paragraph 12 is :<br>
 Almost 70% of these organizations report using a SIEM solution today. Those organizations using external security services are highly likely (93%) to have those services involved with the SIEM in some fashion, most of them (71%) asking the MSSP to run day-to-day SIEM operations. Almost half (45%) of companies without a SIEM intend to deploy the functionality within the next 12 to 18 months.<br>
paragraph 13 is :<br>
 The majority of organizations (55%) reported that firewall logs are the primary source used for advanced threat detection and investigation, followed by endpoint logs (34%) and system logs (32%). Other data, such as logs from VPN activity, web proxies, DNS, and DHCP servers are used by 20% or less. Historical data, important for forensic investigations or historical correlation, is typically retained for between 45 and 60 days. Firewall logs, endpoint threat detection logs, and Active Directory logs are retained for the longest period.<br>
paragraph 14 is :<br>
 More than 65% of organizations with SOCs have formal threat-hunting operations, especially in large enterprise organizations, in which it was reported by almost 75% of those surveyed. Commercial organizations tend more toward an ad-hoc approach, with 41% of them using this less formal method. Only 5% of organizations report no active threat hunting. Formal threat hunting shows a strong relationship with SOC models and maturity levels. A bit more than 60% of organizations running virtual, co-managed, or multifunction SOCs have formal threat hunting, compared with more than 70% of those with dedicated or command SOCs.<br>

 Three major investment priorities During the next 12 to 18 months, organizations plan to invest in three major areas to improve their capabilities: responsiveness, detection, and investigation. Methods of improvement vary by country, organization size, and other attributes. These appear to be dependent on the availability of local resources, whether skilled security personnel, new and enhanced tools, or capable MSSPs.<br>

 In March, the ransomware family KimcilWare appeared. The ransomware does not attack the victims’ machines but instead targets websites that use Magento ecommerce store files. By encrypting the files with a Rijndael (AES) block cipher and appending the extension .kimcilware at the end of each file, the store’s files become useless. The attacker can be contacted on a Hotmail account and after paying US$140 in Bitcoins, the attacker hands over a decryption key to the victim.<br>

 Earlier this year, the Internet blew up over the topic of whether Apple should assist the FBI by providing access to a deceased terrorist’s iPhone. Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, referred to government’s demands as asking for the “equivalent of a master key, capable of opening hundreds of millions of locks.” In the end, the FBI gained access through undisclosed means and withdrew the request, but the notion of backdoor access is something that has been coveted by malware authors, spies, and nation-states for decades. Tactics for accomplishing this goal range from persuading victims via social engineering to hand over the keys to their devices, to intercepting hardware in the supply chain and inserting backdoors to surreptitiously gain remote access. However, the most common method is through the deployment of Trojan software.<br>
paragraph 23 is :<br>
 Most malicious applications today are rotten to the core. They serve one purpose, to profit bad actors, subjecting their victims to attacks. The tactical We see a trend toward objectives of such crimes are generally to reach the target, establish a presence, “Trojanizing” legitimate and persist for an extended time. To reach their targets, attackers either draw applications, which are injected victims in through social engineering or intercept their everyday computer with malicious nonreplicating code. usage, most often through exploitation. In either case, the goal is for those unfortunate enough to cross paths with malicious code to be none the wiser. The longer attacks can go unnoticed, the larger the payout. To this end, attackers are growing more sophisticated as they endeavor to create long lasting, fully undetectable creations. The more authentic-looking a piece of code, the more likely it is to be overlooked. This is the primary driving factor in an increasing trend of “Trojanizing” legitimate applications, which are injected with malicious nonreplicating code.<br>
paragraph 24 is :<br>
 Attacker benefits The abuse of reputable applications affords attackers a number of benefits. Payloads are concealed behind a recognizable brand, contributing to the impression of legitimacy and helping ensure targeted users take the bait. This brand recognition continues after a system has been compromised, through recognizable directory, file, process, and registry key names and attributes. These elements can provide cover during security scans and forensics analysis, with recognizable properties blending with hundreds or even thousands of familiar programs.<br>
paragraph 25 is :<br>
 Another benefit is built-in persistence, or a method of restarting code that was previously terminated. Malware persistence falls into one of two categories: self- persistence, involving the installation of start-up hooks to endure reboots; and companion-persistence, which leverages existing start-up hooks to automatically load before, during, or after other wanted applications. Each system change made by malicious code is an indicator of compromise. Thus the fewer the number of changes, the smaller the detection surface. Trojanizing legitimate applications provides free persistence; the software’s natural method of start-up is all that is necessary for the malicious code to load. In fact, if the program is run manually on a regular basis, then persistence is self-perpetuated by the victims themselves.<br>

 Hacking the Source While binding a clean application to a dirty one may provide some cover for those aiming to dupe users, poisoning the master source code does a far better Binding a clean application to a job. With the ability to add or modify code and configurations, or build scripts, dirty one may provide some cover attackers can impersonate software vendors and inherit the trust they have for those aiming to dupe users, but with their customers. Download servers, code signing, and all of the tenants of poisoning the master source code does a far better job. And when customer-facing authenticity are inherently present once the nefarious code has redistributed libraries are involved, been successfully planted. And when redistributed libraries are involved, this this can result in other trusted can result in other trusted software vendors perpetuating the erroneous trust. software vendors perpetuating the Such was the case last year, when it was reported that the mobiSage software erroneous trust. development kit contained a “backdoored” ad library that was subsequently consumed by thousands of iOS applications, including those distributed via the Apple App Store.<br>

 Client-side patching. Similarly, tools can run on the endpoint to patch local files.<br>
paragraph 28 is :<br>
Regardless of the distribution approach, the binaries are modified to take the place of desired or known applications. Binary patching is perhaps most heavily used today in the realm of Android apps. Kits such as AndroRat and Dendroid are responsible for tens of thousands of copycat apps concealing malicious payloads.<br>
paragraph 29 is :<br>
 BackDoor Factory (BDF) is a popular open-source executable binary patcher that supports Windows, Mac, and Linux binary patching. Target programs are modified to include predefined or user-specified shellcode. BDF allows the operator to specify many options, including the host IP, port, and where to insert the shellcode within the target. Code can be placed in the slack space of a program and spread over one or more cavities, thus maintaining the original file size and executable geometry. This tactic may render certain feature vectors ineffective in machine learning algorithms applied to such threats.<br>
paragraph 30 is :<br>
 Vendor downloads should occur over secure connections and all code should be signed. This drastically reduces man-in-the-middle attacks. Software vendors should include self-validation in their applications, regularly audit their code, use static code analysis tools, and perform peer reviews.<br>

 Binders/Joiners Binder programs first appeared in the 1990s and give malware distributors a quick and easy way to bundle their threats with other programs, documents, and multimedia files. Decoupling the malicious code from any social engineering aspects of an attack affords the perpetrators the benefit of customizing each binary for a given campaign, without having to code or recompile a threat. All that is required to build a new customized threat is to select current malware and accompanying files. The binder will combine all of them into a new executable ready for distribution. When a victim runs the program, both the malware and combined file will be run. Although binders do bundle clean and dirty files together, the result is a new piece of malware, which does not closely resemble a legitimate file.<br>

Dedicated SOCs are in use NOC functionality. 15% have by 15% of companies and are more prevalent in the United States (21%). Virtual dedicated SOCs and 15% have virtual SOCs. SOCs are the third model, also used by about 15% of respondents, followed by a distributed or co-managed SOC, at 11%. Only 2% reported operating a command SOC.<br>

 Which one of the following five types of SOC models comes closest to describing your organization’s SOC?<br>
paragraph 13 is :<br>
Whether from an increase in attacks or better monitoring capabilities, most companies (67%) reported an increase in security incidents, with 51% saying they have increased a little, and 16% that they have increased a lot. This is analogous to findings from the key topic “Information theft: the who, how, and prevention of data leakage” in the McAfee Labs Threats Report: September 2016. That primary research study found that organizations which watched data more closely for leakage reported more data-loss incidents.<br>
paragraph 14 is :<br>
 Only 7% overall indicate that incidents have decreased, and the remaining 25% say that they have remained stable over the past year. There was little variance reported by country, but incidents increased as organizations get smaller, possibly indicating that criminals have broadened their attack targets. Only 45% of the largest organizations (more than 20,000 employees) reported an increase, compared with 73% of the smallest (fewer than 5,000 employees).<br>
paragraph 15 is :<br>
 The small group that reported a decrease in incidents overwhelmingly (96%) believe that this was due to better prevention and processes. Of those who said that incidents increased, the majority feel that it was due to a combination of improved detection capabilities (73%) and more attacks (57%).<br>
paragraph 16 is :<br>
 Most organizations receive some type of security operations assistance from managed security services providers, with 64% of those surveyed using MSSPs About two-thirds of organizations to augment their internal capabilities. Of the 26% that do not use external surveyed receive some type of services, Canadian organizations are the least likely to use one, at 40%. The security operations assistance largest organizations are also more likely to go it alone, at 38%. For those that from managed security services providers. Choosing internal or use MSSPs, the median work with two service providers. German organizations external resources for security are more likely to use three, and Canadian organizations only one. operations is most likely dependent on the availability of internal personnel, external services, and the comparative skill levels.<br>
paragraph 17 is :<br>
 For the next 12 to 18 months, most organizations (71%) expect their MSSP use to remain the same, while 19% expect it to increase and 10% expect it to decrease. Those that expect MSSP use to decrease are bringing more security operations in house to improve incident response and the quality of investigations. Those that expect it to increase are looking to external partners to improve investigations and scoping of potential incidents, and broaden security monitoring and monitoring coverage. Basically, choosing internal or external resources for security operations is most likely dependent on the availability of internal personnel, external services, and the comparative skill levels. As a result, there is some variance by country, with German organizations primarily interested in improving advanced threat detection with MSSPs, and UK outfits looking for help with technology such as big data platforms, analytics, and threat intelligence.<br>
paragraph 18 is :<br>
 Almost 70% of these organizations report using a SIEM solution today. Those organizations using external security services are highly likely (93%) to have those services involved with the SIEM in some fashion, most of them (71%) asking the MSSP to run day-to-day SIEM operations. Almost half (45%) of companies without a SIEM intend to deploy the functionality within the next 12 to 18 months.<br>

There is no significant variation in the percentage all four types of teams. of external resources used by country or organization size. However, it is not surprising that larger organizations have larger teams. Although the median staffing level for Tier 1 teams is 15 people regardless of company size, Tier 2, hunter, and incident responder teams are about 50% larger in enterprises than in commercial organizations.<br>
paragraph 23 is :<br>
 More than 65% of organizations with SOCs have formal threat-hunting operations, especially in large enterprise organizations, in which it was reported by almost 75% of those surveyed. Commercial organizations tend more toward an ad-hoc approach, with 41% of them using this less formal method. Only 5% of organizations report no active threat hunting. Formal threat hunting shows a strong relationship with SOC models and maturity levels. A bit more than 60% of organizations running virtual, co-managed, or multifunction SOCs have formal threat hunting, compared with more than 70% of those with dedicated or command SOCs.<br>

 Next, shift the emphasis to time to detection, containment, and remediation. These times are the most effective way to focus attention and resources where they are most needed. Reducing these security times usually requires a combination of integration, automation, and improving workflows. Anywhere that the number of process steps can be reduced, human interaction eliminated, or duplication removed should be priorities.<br>
paragraph 26 is :<br>
 SOCs are back and continuing to expand SOCs have returned from movie land and become critical components of an organization’s security posture. Data breaches are on the rise, whether from increased attacks or better detection, and SOCs can help security teams triage alerts, respond to incidents, coordinate investigations, and proactively hunt for threats. There is no perfect SOC model. Whether the SOC is internal or external, dedicated or multifunction, the important thing is to continue improving security operations, from reactive to proactive and optimized.<br>
paragraph 27 is :<br>
 Upgraded tools and capabilities still needed Although SOCs have become more common, most organizations are still overwhelmed with alerts and are unable to properly investigate one out of four, resulting in minor or moderate business impacts. As a result, most feel it is important to continue making improvements to their internal security capabilities, continue or increase their use of MSSPs, and invest in additional or enhanced tools.<br>

 At the time, one of the big challenges for attackers was how to get paid without getting caught. They experimented with a variety of methods.

Later that year we also saw an increase in the threat of exposure of sensitive files and trashing the operating system, in addition to encrypting the victim’s data.<br>
paragraph 30 is :<br>
 This year, ransomware found a new and vulnerable target: hospitals. Although there was some criticism from the hacker community about these attacks, many of the victims paid, fueling further incidents. There was no real technical evolution in these attacks, just phishing emails targeting people using essential systems. However, the rest of the year saw considerable technical advances, including partial and full disk encryption, variable and increasing ransom demands, and new ransomware delivery mechanisms.<br>
paragraph 31 is :<br>
 In March, the ransomware family KimcilWare appeared. The ransomware does not attack the victims’ machines but instead targets websites that use Magento ecommerce store files. By encrypting the files with a Rijndael (AES) block cipher and appending the extension .kimcilware at the end of each file, the store’s files become useless. The attacker can be contacted on a Hotmail account and after paying US$140 in Bitcoins, the attacker hands over a decryption key to the victim.<br>
paragraph 32 is :<br>
 Suspicious files are often sent to a “sandbox” for evaluation before being allowed to run on a user’s system. This year, ransomware attackers learned The common “sandbox” method how to differentiate between a sandbox, which is usually a virtual machine, used to detect ransomware can and a live human’s device. In a recent case, Locky, the culprit in many of now be detected and evaded by the hospital ransomware attacks, used encrypted code and execution time some ransomware. differences between real and virtual machines to evade detection. Two API calls, GetProcessHeap() and CloseHandle(), one of which should be about 10 times faster on a real system, are run by the malware, which goes dormant if the execution time difference is not as large as expected.<br>
paragraph 33 is :<br>
 At the same time, the command-line argument “123” is used to execute the ransomware. Sandboxes in general execute the malware without any arguments. By not having the right argument, the ransomware will terminate and cannot be fully analyzed by the sandbox technology. Share this Report<br>
paragraph 34 is :<br>
In 2015 and the first half of 2016, the Angler exploit kit was the most popular mechanism for delivering ransomware to potential victims. These exploit kits are popular and have a strong support system. However, in April and May, the volume of Angler traffic dropped dramatically, eventually shutting down completely. It appeared to have been replaced in popularity by Neutrino, although at nowhere near Angler’s volume of traffic. Another shift in exploit kits happened in September, with RIG rising to challenge Neutrino for top spot. Whatever is driving these changes in the ransomware delivery marketplace, expect continued variations as attackers look for new ways to evade defenses.<br>

 Earlier this year, the Internet blew up over the topic of whether Apple should assist the FBI by providing access to a deceased terrorist’s iPhone. Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, referred to government’s demands as asking for the “equivalent of a master key, capable of opening hundreds of millions of locks.” In the end, the FBI gained access through undisclosed means and withdrew the request, but the notion of backdoor access is something that has been coveted by malware authors, spies, and nation-states for decades. Tactics for accomplishing this goal range from persuading victims via social engineering to hand over the keys to their devices, to intercepting hardware in the supply chain and inserting backdoors to surreptitiously gain remote access. However, the most common method is through the deployment of Trojan software.<br>
paragraph 39 is :<br>
 Most malicious applications today are rotten to the core. They serve one purpose, to profit bad actors, subjecting their victims to attacks. The tactical We see a trend toward objectives of such crimes are generally to reach the target, establish a presence, “Trojanizing” legitimate and persist for an extended time. To reach their targets, attackers either draw applications, which are injected victims in through social engineering or intercept their everyday computer with malicious nonreplicating code. usage, most often through exploitation. In either case, the goal is for those unfortunate enough to cross paths with malicious code to be none the wiser. The longer attacks can go unnoticed, the larger the payout. To this end, attackers are growing more sophisticated as they endeavor to create long lasting, fully undetectable creations. The more authentic-looking a piece of code, the more likely it is to be overlooked. This is the primary driving factor in an increasing trend of “Trojanizing” legitimate applications, which are injected with malicious nonreplicating code.<br>
paragraph 40 is :<br>
 Attacker benefits The abuse of reputable applications affords attackers a number of benefits. Payloads are concealed behind a recognizable brand, contributing to the impression of legitimacy and helping ensure targeted users take the bait. This brand recognition continues after a system has been compromised, through recognizable directory, file, process, and registry key names and attributes. These elements can provide cover during security scans and forensics analysis, with recognizable properties blending with hundreds or even thousands of familiar programs.<br>
paragraph 41 is :<br>
 Another benefit is built-in persistence, or a method of restarting code that was previously terminated. Malware persistence falls into one of two categories: self- persistence, involving the installation of start-up hooks to endure reboots; and companion-persistence, which leverages existing start-up hooks to automatically load before, during, or after other wanted applications. Each system change made by malicious code is an indicator of compromise. Thus the fewer the number of changes, the smaller the detection surface. Trojanizing legitimate applications provides free persistence; the software’s natural method of start-up is all that is necessary for the malicious code to load. In fact, if the program is run manually on a regular basis, then persistence is self-perpetuated by the victims themselves.<br>
paragraph 42 is :<br>
 Binders/Joiners Binder programs first appeared in the 1990s and give malware distributors a quick and easy way to bundle their threats with other programs, documents, and multimedia files. Decoupling the malicious code from any social engineering aspects of an attack affords the perpetrators the benefit of customizing each binary for a given campaign, without having to code or recompile a threat. All that is required to build a new customized threat is to select current malware and accompanying files. The binder will combine all of them into a new executable ready for distribution. When a victim runs the program, both the malware and combined file will be run. Although binders do bundle clean and dirty files together, the result is a new piece of malware, which does not closely resemble a legitimate file.<br>
paragraph 43 is :<br>
 The Celesty File Binder remains one of the most common binder programs in use.<br>
paragraph 44 is :<br>
 Modifying a copy of the source code is much simpler to do, especially with interpreted, open source, or decompiled code. Adding or modifying routines here The rapid growth of Android is straightforward for anyone comfortable coding in the relevant programming malware can be attributed to the language. modification of source code.<br>
paragraph 45 is :<br>
 Patchers Binary patching programs have emerged in the last couple of years to simplify the process of adding payloads to already compiled applications. Unlike Binary patching programs have binders, patchers modify executables rather than create new ones. Payloads are emerged in the last couple of strategically inserted with the goal of seamlessly maintaining application usage. years to simplify the process These tools can be used in three scenarios: attacker/server side, client side, or of adding malware payloads to already compiled applications. man in the middle.<br>
paragraph 46 is :<br>
 The Backdoor Factory Proxy (BDFProxy) takes BDF a step further by patching executables on the fly as they are downloaded, leveraging a man-in-the- middle attack posture. Joshua Pitts, the author of the BDF tools, discovered this approach was actively being used in the wild in 2014 when applications were downloaded via a Tor exit node in Russia. This discovery was made within about an hour after the beginning of his search. In particular, all uncompressed Windows executable files served over nonsecured HTTP connections were modified to include the OnionDuke malware.<br>
paragraph 47 is :<br>
 These attack scenarios apply to the majority of Internet users. Even those who seldom install new applications are likely to have existing applications configured for autoupdates. It is still commonplace for update servers to deliver binaries over insecure HTTP connections. Connecting to open Wi-Fi hotspots provides others an opportunity to carry out man-in-the-middle attacks. Running untrusted programs remains a significant attack vector, and the ever-growing use of shared libraries increases the overall risk, especially as it pertains to mobile devices and the Internet of Things.<br>
paragraph 48 is :<br>
 Security software should include dynamic analysis to flag rogue actions regardless of initial binary inspection because static scanning goes only so far. Behavioral monitoring, web and IP reputation, memory scanning, and application containment are welcome components in a complete solution.<br>
paragraph 49 is :<br>
 The problem of Trojanized legitimate applications is likely to get worse before it gets better. Research and development advancements in penetration testing and vulnerability assessment make it easier to both discover vulnerable applications and systems, as well as exploit them. We have seen how such tools are combined and improved. Defenses must evolve similarly to overcome this increasing threat.<br>

If you were not in the defense department or on Wall Street, many thought, then you did not need a SOC. Then targeted attacks and insider threats moved from movie and government plots to an everyday reality for enterprises. According to an Intel Security survey, 68% of investigations in 2015 involved a specific entity, either as a targeted external attack or an insider threat.<br>
paragraph 4 is :<br>
 The ability to quickly identify, investigate, and resolve threats is probably the most important aspect of today’s security operations. Preventing 100% of attacks may never be achievable, but security information and event management (SIEM) often provides a real-time understanding of the world outside—threat data, reputation feeds, and vulnerability status—as well as a view of the systems, users, data, risks, and activities inside, obtained through continuous monitoring and correlation. Actionable intelligence and situational awareness delivered by a SIEM may help orchestrate security operations and, when an incident is detected, may enable better collaboration for faster incident response.<br>

 For the next 12 to 18 months, most organizations (71%) expect their MSSP use to remain the same, while 19% expect it to increase and 10% expect it to decrease. Those that expect MSSP use to decrease are bringing more security operations in house to improve incident response and the quality of investigations. Those that expect it to increase are looking to external partners to improve investigations and scoping of potential incidents, and broaden security monitoring and monitoring coverage. Basically, choosing internal or external resources for security operations is most likely dependent on the availability of internal personnel, external services, and the comparative skill levels. As a result, there is some variance by country, with German organizations primarily interested in improving advanced threat detection with MSSPs, and UK outfits looking for help with technology such as big data platforms, analytics, and threat intelligence.<br>

Methods to address these goals include the three pillars of people, processes, and technology. Of the organizations that do not yet have all four types of security teams operating, 40% plan to deploy internal people into those roles within 12 to 18 months. Similarly, around 40% of organizations plan to increase their use of MSSP people within one or more of these security functions in that period. Deploying new security technology is another way to enhance capabilities, with more than 60% of organizations planning to invest in tools for these teams. Given the significant percentage of organizations that are not managing to triage and investigate all of their alerts, it is not surprising that key processes are the top two focus areas for new tools: improving the speed and accuracy of initial triage and prioritization of security alerts, and reducing the time and effort it takes to conduct incident investigations.<br>
paragraph 7 is :<br>
Security analytics is of growing interest to help address the volume of alerts, and is already in use by 67% of these organizations. Detection is reported as the number one purpose today for analytics, but prioritization and risk assessment are likely to be the top two drivers for future adoption of security analytics during the next 12 to 18 months.<br>

Those who reported a decline in investigations of incidents attributed this improvement to better protection and processes, which mature organizations perform as the final stage of a security investigation.<br>
paragraph 7 is :<br>
 Almost nine out of 10 organizations in this study reported that they have an internal or external SOC, although commercial organizations are slightly less likely to have one (84%) compared with enterprises (91%). Smaller organizations in general are implementing SOCs a bit later than enterprises, as only 44% of commercial groups have had one for more than 12 months, whereas 56% of enterprise SOCs have been around for that long. Most SOCs (60%) are currently run internally, with 23% operating a mix of internal and external support, and 17% fully external. For the few that have not established a SOC, only 2% of enterprises have no plans to do so, versus 7% of commercial companies.<br>

However, it is not surprising that larger organizations have larger teams. Although the median staffing level for Tier 1 teams is 15 people regardless of company size, Tier 2, hunter, and incident responder teams are about 50% larger in enterprises than in commercial organizations.<br>
paragraph 24 is :<br>
 More than 65% of organizations with SOCs have formal threat-hunting operations, especially in large enterprise organizations, in which it was reported by almost 75% of those surveyed. Commercial organizations tend more toward an ad-hoc approach, with 41% of them using this less formal method. Only 5% of organizations report no active threat hunting. Formal threat hunting shows a strong relationship with SOC models and maturity levels. A bit more than 60% of organizations running virtual, co-managed, or multifunction SOCs have formal threat hunting, compared with more than 70% of those with dedicated or command SOCs.<br>

 Most of these organizations consider themselves to be similar to their peers in information security investments and speed of adoption of new security capabilities. However, around 30% think that they are above average in investment or technology adoption, and only about 10% think they are below average.<br>
paragraph 26 is :<br>
Methods to address these goals include the three pillars of people, processes, and technology. Of the organizations that do not yet have all four types of security teams operating, 40% plan to deploy internal people into those roles within 12 to 18 months. Similarly, around 40% of organizations plan to increase their use of MSSP people within one or more of these security functions in that period.

paragraph 28 is :<br>
Advancing the maturity level of a SOC involves three design principles. First, objectively evaluate the current level of organization maturity. What are the team’s strengths and weaknesses, where are the gaps, and what is the risk posture? As part of this, identify the metrics necessary for ongoing evaluation, and the data necessary to calculate them.<br>
paragraph 29 is :<br>
 SOCs are back and continuing to expand SOCs have returned from movie land and become critical components of an organization’s security posture. Data breaches are on the rise, whether from increased attacks or better detection, and SOCs can help security teams triage alerts, respond to incidents, coordinate investigations, and proactively hunt for threats. There is no perfect SOC model. Whether the SOC is internal or external, dedicated or multifunction, the important thing is to continue improving security operations, from reactive to proactive and optimized.<br>
paragraph 30 is :<br>
 Upgraded tools and capabilities still needed Although SOCs have become more common, most organizations are still overwhelmed with alerts and are unable to properly investigate one out of four, resulting in minor or moderate business impacts. As a result, most feel it is important to continue making improvements to their internal security capabilities, continue or increase their use of MSSPs, and invest in additional or enhanced tools.<br>

 Petya also brought on increasing ransom demands, doubling the amount if payment was not made within seven days. One ransomware variant threatened to delete one file per hour until the ransom was paid. Another encoded a series of ransom amounts, which it chose based on the name of the distribution file, making it quick and easy to make the demand fit the victim’s ability to pay. In another case, a hospital that paid the first ransom demand was then told to pay again if it wanted to regain access to all of the files. The hospital ignored the second demand, but it remains an ongoing concern that attackers will not be “honorable” in their actions and refuse to release encryption keys even after receiving payment.<br>

 KimcilWare’s possible author is also associated with another piece of ransomware that is based on the proof-of-concept ransomware code Hidden Tear. In 2016, we have seen many ransomware samples based on this proof of concept code. The following image illustrates the correlation between different ransomware families associated with this code:<br>
paragraph 5 is :<br>
 Suspicious files are often sent to a “sandbox” for evaluation before being allowed to run on a user’s system.

Mamba also adapted the previously described anti–virtual machine technique, using a password as a command-line argument to execute the malware.<br>
paragraph 7 is :<br>
 Most malicious applications today are rotten to the core. They serve one purpose, to profit bad actors, subjecting their victims to attacks. The tactical We see a trend toward objectives of such crimes are generally to reach the target, establish a presence, “Trojanizing” legitimate and persist for an extended time. To reach their targets, attackers either draw applications, which are injected victims in through social engineering or intercept their everyday computer with malicious nonreplicating code. usage, most often through exploitation. In either case, the goal is for those unfortunate enough to cross paths with malicious code to be none the wiser. The longer attacks can go unnoticed, the larger the payout. To this end, attackers are growing more sophisticated as they endeavor to create long lasting, fully undetectable creations. The more authentic-looking a piece of code, the more likely it is to be overlooked. This is the primary driving factor in an increasing trend of “Trojanizing” legitimate applications, which are injected with malicious nonreplicating code.<br>
paragraph 8 is :<br>
 Another benefit is built-in persistence, or a method of restarting code that was previously terminated. Malware persistence falls into one of two categories: self- persistence, involving the installation of start-up hooks to endure reboots; and companion-persistence, which leverages existing start-up hooks to automatically load before, during, or after other wanted applications. Each system change made by malicious code is an indicator of compromise. Thus the fewer the number of changes, the smaller the detection surface. Trojanizing legitimate applications provides free persistence; the software’s natural method of start-up is all that is necessary for the malicious code to load. In fact, if the program is run manually on a regular basis, then persistence is self-perpetuated by the victims themselves.<br>
paragraph 9 is :<br>
 The idea of riding on the coattails of popular applications harkens to the early days of malware creation, arguably with the inception decades ago of the very first parasitic file-infecting virus. Viruses differ from Trojans in that they recursively self-replicate, meaning that they spread to other files, those files in turn spread to other files, and so on. Part of the threat is the replication logic, which decides the files to target and where to insert malicious routines. Viruses can be analyzed and reverse engineered, and the replication logic and markers provide an additional detection surface for antivirus software. Parasitic Trojans, on the other hand, do not self-replicate, allowing for inserted code to be streamlined toward the desired payload without the additional overhead and corresponding detection surface. This can be an Achilles heel for defenses that are ill equipped to cope with such attacks.<br>
paragraph 10 is :<br>
 Binders/Joiners Binder programs first appeared in the 1990s and give malware distributors a quick and easy way to bundle their threats with other programs, documents, and multimedia files. Decoupling the malicious code from any social engineering aspects of an attack affords the perpetrators the benefit of customizing each binary for a given campaign, without having to code or recompile a threat. All that is required to build a new customized threat is to select current malware and accompanying files. The binder will combine all of them into a new executable ready for distribution. When a victim runs the program, both the malware and combined file will be run. Although binders do bundle clean and dirty files together, the result is a new piece of malware, which does not closely resemble a legitimate file.<br>

 BackDoor Factory (BDF) is a popular open-source executable binary patcher that supports Windows, Mac, and Linux binary patching. Target programs are modified to include predefined or user-specified shellcode. BDF allows the operator to specify many options, including the host IP, port, and where to insert the shellcode within the target. Code can be placed in the slack space of a program and spread over one or more cavities, thus maintaining the original file size and executable geometry. This tactic may render certain feature vectors ineffective in machine learning algorithms applied to such threats.<br>

 In March, the ransomware family KimcilWare appeared. The ransomware does not attack the victims’ machines but instead targets websites that use Magento ecommerce store files. By encrypting the files with a Rijndael (AES) block cipher and appending the extension .kimcilware at the end of each file, the store’s files become useless. The attacker can be contacted on a Hotmail account and after paying US$140 in Bitcoins, the attacker hands over a decryption key to the victim.<br>

In 2015 and the first half of 2016, the Angler exploit kit was the most popular mechanism for delivering ransomware to potential victims. These exploit kits are popular and have a strong support system. However, in April and May, the volume of Angler traffic dropped dramatically, eventually shutting down completely. It appeared to have been replaced in popularity by Neutrino, although at nowhere near Angler’s volume of traffic. Another shift in exploit kits happened in September, with RIG rising to challenge Neutrino for top spot. Whatever is driving these changes in the ransomware delivery marketplace, expect continued variations as attackers look for new ways to evade defenses.<br>

 Binders/Joiners Binder programs first appeared in the 1990s and give malware distributors a quick and easy way to bundle their threats with other programs, documents, and multimedia files. Decoupling the malicious code from any social engineering aspects of an attack affords the perpetrators the benefit of customizing each binary for a given campaign, without having to code or recompile a threat. All that is required to build a new customized threat is to select current malware and accompanying files. The binder will combine all of them into a new executable ready for distribution. When a victim runs the program, both the malware and combined file will be run. Although binders do bundle clean and dirty files together, the result is a new piece of malware, which does not closely resemble a legitimate file.<br>

 The ability to quickly identify, investigate, and resolve threats is probably the most important aspect of today’s security operations. Preventing 100% of attacks may never be achievable, but security information and event management (SIEM) often provides a real-time understanding of the world outside—threat data, reputation feeds, and vulnerability status—as well as a view of the systems, users, data, risks, and activities inside, obtained through continuous monitoring and correlation. Actionable intelligence and situational awareness delivered by a SIEM may help orchestrate security operations and, when an incident is detected, may enable better collaboration for faster incident response.<br>

paragraph 14 is :<br>
 Attacker benefits The abuse of reputable applications affords attackers a number of benefits. Payloads are concealed behind a recognizable brand, contributing to the impression of legitimacy and helping ensure targeted users take the bait. This brand recognition continues after a system has been compromised, through recognizable directory, file, process, and registry key names and attributes. These elements can provide cover during security scans and forensics analysis, with recognizable properties blending with hundreds or even thousands of familiar programs.<br>
paragraph 15 is :<br>
 Another benefit is built-in persistence, or a method of restarting code that was previously terminated. Malware persistence falls into one of two categories: self- persistence, involving the installation of start-up hooks to endure reboots; and companion-persistence, which leverages existing start-up hooks to automatically load before, during, or after other wanted applications. Each system change made by malicious code is an indicator of compromise. Thus the fewer the number of changes, the smaller the detection surface. Trojanizing legitimate applications provides free persistence; the software’s natural method of start-up is all that is necessary for the malicious code to load. In fact, if the program is run manually on a regular basis, then persistence is self-perpetuated by the victims themselves.<br>
paragraph 16 is :<br>
 The idea of riding on the coattails of popular applications harkens to the early days of malware creation, arguably with the inception decades ago of the very first parasitic file-infecting virus. Viruses differ from Trojans in that they recursively self-replicate, meaning that they spread to other files, those files in turn spread to other files, and so on. Part of the threat is the replication logic, which decides the files to target and where to insert malicious routines. Viruses can be analyzed and reverse engineered, and the replication logic and markers provide an additional detection surface for antivirus software. Parasitic Trojans, on the other hand, do not self-replicate, allowing for inserted code to be streamlined toward the desired payload without the additional overhead and corresponding detection surface. This can be an Achilles heel for defenses that are ill equipped to cope with such attacks.<br>

 These attack scenarios apply to the majority of Internet users. Even those who seldom install new applications are likely to have existing applications configured for autoupdates. It is still commonplace for update servers to deliver binaries over insecure HTTP connections. Connecting to open Wi-Fi hotspots provides others an opportunity to carry out man-in-the-middle attacks. Running untrusted programs remains a significant attack vector, and the ever-growing use of shared libraries increases the overall risk, especially as it pertains to mobile devices and the Internet of Things.<br>

paragraph 9 is :<br>
Methods to address these goals include the three pillars of people, processes, and technology. Of the organizations that do not yet have all four types of security teams operating, 40% plan to deploy internal people into those roles within 12 to 18 months. Similarly, around 40% of organizations plan to increase their use of MSSP people within one or more of these security functions in that period. Deploying new security technology is another way to enhance capabilities, with more than 60% of organizations planning to invest in tools for these teams. Given the significant percentage of organizations that are not managing to triage and investigate all of their alerts, it is not surprising that key processes are the top two focus areas for new tools: improving the speed and accuracy of initial triage and prioritization of security alerts, and reducing the time and effort it takes to conduct incident investigations.<br>

 Next, shift the emphasis to time to detection, containment, and remediation. These times are the most effective way to focus attention and resources where they are most needed.

 Most malicious applications today are rotten to the core. They serve one purpose, to profit bad actors, subjecting their victims to attacks. The tactical We see a trend toward objectives of such crimes are generally to reach the target, establish a presence, “Trojanizing” legitimate and persist for an extended time. To reach their targets, attackers either draw applications, which are injected victims in through social engineering or intercept their everyday computer with malicious nonreplicating code. usage, most often through exploitation. In either case, the goal is for those unfortunate enough to cross paths with malicious code to be none the wiser. The longer attacks can go unnoticed, the larger the payout. To this end, attackers are growing more sophisticated as they endeavor to create long lasting, fully undetectable creations. The more authentic-looking a piece of code, the more likely it is to be overlooked. This is the primary driving factor in an increasing trend of “Trojanizing” legitimate applications, which are injected with malicious nonreplicating code.<br>

 Most malicious applications today are rotten to the core. They serve one purpose, to profit bad actors, subjecting their victims to attacks. The tactical We see a trend toward objectives of such crimes are generally to reach the target, establish a presence, “Trojanizing” legitimate and persist for an extended time. To reach their targets, attackers either draw applications, which are injected victims in through social engineering or intercept their everyday computer with malicious nonreplicating code. usage, most often through exploitation. In either case, the goal is for those unfortunate enough to cross paths with malicious code to be none the wiser. The longer attacks can go unnoticed, the larger the payout. To this end, attackers are growing more sophisticated as they endeavor to create long lasting, fully undetectable creations. The more authentic-looking a piece of code, the more likely it is to be overlooked. This is the primary driving factor in an increasing trend of “Trojanizing” legitimate applications, which are injected with malicious nonreplicating code.<br>

 The Backdoor Factory Proxy (BDFProxy) takes BDF a step further by patching executables on the fly as they are downloaded, leveraging a man-in-the- middle attack posture. Joshua Pitts, the author of the BDF tools, discovered this approach was actively being used in the wild in 2014 when applications were downloaded via a Tor exit node in Russia. This discovery was made within about an hour after the beginning of his search. In particular, all uncompressed Windows executable files served over nonsecured HTTP connections were modified to include the OnionDuke malware.<br>

 This year, ransomware found a new and vulnerable target: hospitals. Although there was some criticism from the hacker community about these attacks, many of the victims paid, fueling further incidents. There was no real technical evolution in these attacks, just phishing emails targeting people using essential systems. However, the rest of the year saw considerable technical advances, including partial and full disk encryption, variable and increasing ransom demands, and new ransomware delivery mechanisms.<br>
paragraph 2 is :<br>
 These attack scenarios apply to the majority of Internet users. Even those who seldom install new applications are likely to have existing applications configured for autoupdates. It is still commonplace for update servers to deliver binaries over insecure HTTP connections. Connecting to open Wi-Fi hotspots provides others an opportunity to carry out man-in-the-middle attacks. Running untrusted programs remains a significant attack vector, and the ever-growing use of shared libraries increases the overall risk, especially as it pertains to mobile devices and the Internet of Things.<br>

 Three major investment priorities During the next 12 to 18 months, organizations plan to invest in three major areas to improve their capabilities: responsiveness, detection, and investigation. Methods of improvement vary by country, organization size, and other attributes.

This ransomware is often delivered via a fake job-applicant email In March we saw the appearance with a Dropbox link, and begins the attack by overwriting the master boot record, partial disk encryption instead rebooting, and executing the malware, putting up a fake CHKDSK screen that of file encryption. This type of encrypts the master file table. While the files are still on the disk and unaffected, ransomware encrypts the master file table, making files inaccessible. the encrypted file table prevents them from being located. Paying the ransom gets the decryption key, which unlocks the file table and boot record, and removes the malware boot loader.<br>

 In March, the ransomware family KimcilWare appeared. The ransomware does not attack the victims’ machines but instead targets websites that use Magento ecommerce store files. By encrypting the files with a Rijndael (AES) block cipher and appending the extension .kimcilware at the end of each file, the store’s files become useless. The attacker can be contacted on a Hotmail account and after paying US$140 in Bitcoins, the attacker hands over a decryption key to the victim.<br>

In 2015 and the first half of 2016, the Angler exploit kit was the most popular mechanism for delivering ransomware to potential victims. These exploit kits are popular and have a strong support system. However, in April and May, the volume of Angler traffic dropped dramatically, eventually shutting down completely. It appeared to have been replaced in popularity by Neutrino, although at nowhere near Angler’s volume of traffic. Another shift in exploit kits happened in September, with RIG rising to challenge Neutrino for top spot. Whatever is driving these changes in the ransomware delivery marketplace, expect continued variations as attackers look for new ways to evade defenses.<br>

 Binders/Joiners Binder programs first appeared in the 1990s and give malware distributors a quick and easy way to bundle their threats with other programs, documents, and multimedia files. Decoupling the malicious code from any social engineering aspects of an attack affords the perpetrators the benefit of customizing each binary for a given campaign, without having to code or recompile a threat. All that is required to build a new customized threat is to select current malware and accompanying files. The binder will combine all of them into a new executable ready for distribution. When a victim runs the program, both the malware and combined file will be run. Although binders do bundle clean and dirty files together, the result is a new piece of malware, which does not closely resemble a legitimate file.<br>

 Almost nine out of 10 organizations in this study reported that they have an internal or external SOC, although commercial organizations are slightly less likely to have one (84%) compared with enterprises (91%). Smaller organizations in general are implementing SOCs a bit later than enterprises, as only 44% of commercial groups have had one for more than 12 months, whereas 56% of enterprise SOCs have been around for that long. Most SOCs (60%) are currently run internally, with 23% operating a mix of internal and external support, and 17% fully external.

Those that expect MSSP use to decrease are bringing more security operations in house to improve incident response and the quality of investigations. Those that expect it to increase are looking to external partners to improve investigations and scoping of potential incidents, and broaden security monitoring and monitoring coverage. Basically, choosing internal or external resources for security operations is most likely dependent on the availability of internal personnel, external services, and the comparative skill levels.

Methods to address these goals include the three pillars of people, processes, and technology. Of the organizations that do not yet have all four types of security teams operating, 40% plan to deploy internal people into those roles within 12 to 18 months. Similarly, around 40% of organizations plan to increase their use of MSSP people within one or more of these security functions in that period. Deploying new security technology is another way to enhance capabilities, with more than 60% of organizations planning to invest in tools for these teams. Given the significant percentage of organizations that are not managing to triage and investigate all of their alerts, it is not surprising that key processes are the top two focus areas for new tools: improving the speed and accuracy of initial triage and prioritization of security alerts, and reducing the time and effort it takes to conduct incident investigations.<br>

 This year, ransomware found a new and vulnerable target: hospitals. Although there was some criticism from the hacker community about these attacks, many of the victims paid, fueling further incidents. There was no real technical evolution in these attacks, just phishing emails targeting people using essential systems. However, the rest of the year saw considerable technical advances, including partial and full disk encryption, variable and increasing ransom demands, and new ransomware delivery mechanisms.<br>

Whether from an increase in attacks or better monitoring capabilities, most companies (67%) reported an increase in security incidents, with 51% saying they have increased a little, and 16% that they have increased a lot. This is analogous to findings from the key topic “Information theft: the who, how, and prevention of data leakage” in the McAfee Labs Threats Report: September 2016. That primary research study found that organizations which watched data more closely for leakage reported more data-loss incidents.<br>

 For the next 12 to 18 months, most organizations (71%) expect their MSSP use to remain the same, while 19% expect it to increase and 10% expect it to decrease. Those that expect MSSP use to decrease are bringing more security operations in house to improve incident response and the quality of investigations. Those that expect it to increase are looking to external partners to improve investigations and scoping of potential incidents, and broaden security monitoring and monitoring coverage. Basically, choosing internal or external resources for security operations is most likely dependent on the availability of internal personnel, external services, and the comparative skill levels. As a result, there is some variance by country, with German organizations primarily interested in improving advanced threat detection with MSSPs, and UK outfits looking for help with technology such as big data platforms, analytics, and threat intelligence.<br>

 The majority of organizations (55%) reported that firewall logs are the primary source used for advanced threat detection and investigation, followed by endpoint logs (34%) and system logs (32%). Other data, such as logs from VPN activity, web proxies, DNS, and DHCP servers are used by 20% or less. Historical data, important for forensic investigations or historical correlation, is typically retained for between 45 and 60 days. Firewall logs, endpoint threat detection logs, and Active Directory logs are retained for the longest period.<br>

 Ransomware dates to 1989, when 20,000 infected floppy disks were distributed at the World Health Organization’s AIDS conference. Using symmetric encryption, this attack was quickly broken. The first asymmetric encryption implemented in a cryptovirus attack was published in Adam Young’s 1995 master’s thesis: “Cryptovirology and the Dark Side of Black Box Cryptography.” The size of the virus was a little less than 7KB. It was not until the mid-2000s that asymmetric encryption, which is much more difficult to decipher, was used in a ransomware attack.<br>

 At the same time, the command-line argument “123” is used to execute the ransomware. Sandboxes in general execute the malware without any arguments. By not having the right argument, the ransomware will terminate and cannot be fully analyzed by the sandbox technology. Share this Report<br>
paragraph 13 is :<br>
 The idea of riding on the coattails of popular applications harkens to the early days of malware creation, arguably with the inception decades ago of the very first parasitic file-infecting virus. Viruses differ from Trojans in that they recursively self-replicate, meaning that they spread to other files, those files in turn spread to other files, and so on. Part of the threat is the replication logic, which decides the files to target and where to insert malicious routines. Viruses can be analyzed and reverse engineered, and the replication logic and markers provide an additional detection surface for antivirus software. Parasitic Trojans, on the other hand, do not self-replicate, allowing for inserted code to be streamlined toward the desired payload without the additional overhead and corresponding detection surface. This can be an Achilles heel for defenses that are ill equipped to cope with such attacks.<br>

 Petya also brought on increasing ransom demands, doubling the amount if payment was not made within seven days. One ransomware variant threatened to delete one file per hour until the ransom was paid. Another encoded a series of ransom amounts, which it chose based on the name of the distribution file, making it quick and easy to make the demand fit the victim’s ability to pay. In another case, a hospital that paid the first ransom demand was then told to pay again if it wanted to regain access to all of the files. The hospital ignored the second demand, but it remains an ongoing concern that attackers will not be “honorable” in their actions and refuse to release encryption keys even after receiving payment.<br>

 “Trojanized” legitimate software is on the rise —Craig Schmugar<br>
paragraph 8 is :<br>
 Most malicious applications today are rotten to the core. They serve one purpose, to profit bad actors, subjecting their victims to attacks. The tactical We see a trend toward objectives of such crimes are generally to reach the target, establish a presence, “Trojanizing” legitimate and persist for an extended time. To reach their targets, attackers either draw applications, which are injected victims in through social engineering or intercept their everyday computer with malicious nonreplicating code. usage, most often through exploitation. In either case, the goal is for those unfortunate enough to cross paths with malicious code to be none the wiser. The longer attacks can go unnoticed, the larger the payout. To this end, attackers are growing more sophisticated as they endeavor to create long lasting, fully undetectable creations. The more authentic-looking a piece of code, the more likely it is to be overlooked. This is the primary driving factor in an increasing trend of “Trojanizing” legitimate applications, which are injected with malicious nonreplicating code.<br>
paragraph 9 is :<br>
 Another benefit is built-in persistence, or a method of restarting code that was previously terminated. Malware persistence falls into one of two categories: self- persistence, involving the installation of start-up hooks to endure reboots; and companion-persistence, which leverages existing start-up hooks to automatically load before, during, or after other wanted applications. Each system change made by malicious code is an indicator of compromise. Thus the fewer the number of changes, the smaller the detection surface. Trojanizing legitimate applications provides free persistence; the software’s natural method of start-up is all that is necessary for the malicious code to load. In fact, if the program is run manually on a regular basis, then persistence is self-perpetuated by the victims themselves.<br>
paragraph 10 is :<br>
 Binders/Joiners Binder programs first appeared in the 1990s and give malware distributors a quick and easy way to bundle their threats with other programs, documents, and multimedia files. Decoupling the malicious code from any social engineering aspects of an attack affords the perpetrators the benefit of customizing each binary for a given campaign, without having to code or recompile a threat. All that is required to build a new customized threat is to select current malware and accompanying files. The binder will combine all of them into a new executable ready for distribution. When a victim runs the program, both the malware and combined file will be run. Although binders do bundle clean and dirty files together, the result is a new piece of malware, which does not closely resemble a legitimate file.<br>
paragraph 11 is :<br>
 The problem of Trojanized legitimate applications is likely to get worse before it gets better. Research and development advancements in penetration testing and vulnerability assessment make it easier to both discover vulnerable applications and systems, as well as exploit them. We have seen how such tools are combined and improved. Defenses must evolve similarly to overcome this increasing threat.<br>

If you were not in the defense department or on Wall Street, many thought, then you did not need a SOC. Then targeted attacks and insider threats moved from movie and government plots to an everyday reality for enterprises.

 In March, the ransomware family KimcilWare appeared. The ransomware does not attack the victims’ machines but instead targets websites that use Magento ecommerce store files. By encrypting the files with a Rijndael (AES) block cipher and appending the extension .kimcilware at the end of each file, the store’s files become useless. The attacker can be contacted on a Hotmail account and after paying US$140 in Bitcoins, the attacker hands over a decryption key to the victim.<br>

Each system change made by malicious code is an indicator of compromise. Thus the fewer the number of changes, the smaller the detection surface. Trojanizing legitimate applications provides free persistence; the software’s natural method of start-up is all that is necessary for the malicious code to load. In fact, if the program is run manually on a regular basis, then persistence is self-perpetuated by the victims themselves.<br>

 The idea of riding on the coattails of popular applications harkens to the early days of malware creation, arguably with the inception decades ago of the very first parasitic file-infecting virus. Viruses differ from Trojans in that they recursively self-replicate, meaning that they spread to other files, those files in turn spread to other files, and so on. Part of the threat is the replication logic, which decides the files to target and where to insert malicious routines. Viruses can be analyzed and reverse engineered, and the replication logic and markers provide an additional detection surface for antivirus software. Parasitic Trojans, on the other hand, do not self-replicate, allowing for inserted code to be streamlined toward the desired payload without the additional overhead and corresponding detection surface. This can be an Achilles heel for defenses that are ill equipped to cope with such attacks.<br>

 Binders/Joiners Binder programs first appeared in the 1990s and give malware distributors a quick and easy way to bundle their threats with other programs, documents, and multimedia files. Decoupling the malicious code from any social engineering aspects of an attack affords the perpetrators the benefit of customizing each binary for a given campaign, without having to code or recompile a threat. All that is required to build a new customized threat is to select current malware and accompanying files. The binder will combine all of them into a new executable ready for distribution. When a victim runs the program, both the malware and combined file will be run. Although binders do bundle clean and dirty files together, the result is a new piece of malware, which does not closely resemble a legitimate file.<br>

In 2015 and the first half of 2016, the Angler exploit kit was the most popular mechanism for delivering ransomware to potential victims. These exploit kits are popular and have a strong support system. However, in April and May, the volume of Angler traffic dropped dramatically, eventually shutting down completely. It appeared to have been replaced in popularity by Neutrino, although at nowhere near Angler’s volume of traffic. Another shift in exploit kits happened in September, with RIG rising to challenge Neutrino for top spot.

 BackDoor Factory (BDF) is a popular open-source executable binary patcher that supports Windows, Mac, and Linux binary patching. Target programs are modified to include predefined or user-specified shellcode. BDF allows the operator to specify many options, including the host IP, port, and where to insert the shellcode within the target. Code can be placed in the slack space of a program and spread over one or more cavities, thus maintaining the original file size and executable geometry. This tactic may render certain feature vectors ineffective in machine learning algorithms applied to such threats.<br>

 These attack scenarios apply to the majority of Internet users. Even those who seldom install new applications are likely to have existing applications configured for autoupdates. It is still commonplace for update servers to deliver binaries over insecure HTTP connections. Connecting to open Wi-Fi hotspots provides others an opportunity to carry out man-in-the-middle attacks. Running untrusted programs remains a significant attack vector, and the ever-growing use of shared libraries increases the overall risk, especially as it pertains to mobile devices and the Internet of Things.<br>

 Petya also brought on increasing ransom demands, doubling the amount if payment was not made within seven days. One ransomware variant threatened to delete one file per hour until the ransom was paid. Another encoded a series of ransom amounts, which it chose based on the name of the distribution file, making it quick and easy to make the demand fit the victim’s ability to pay. In another case, a hospital that paid the first ransom demand was then told to pay again if it wanted to regain access to all of the files.

 Ransomware dates to 1989, when 20,000 infected floppy disks were distributed at the World Health Organization’s AIDS conference. Using symmetric encryption, this attack was quickly broken. The first asymmetric encryption implemented in a cryptovirus attack was published in Adam Young’s 1995 master’s thesis: “Cryptovirology and the Dark Side of Black Box Cryptography.” The size of the virus was a little less than 7KB. It was not until the mid-2000s that asymmetric encryption, which is much more difficult to decipher, was used in a ransomware attack.<br>

paragraph 6 is :<br>
 For the next 12 to 18 months, most organizations (71%) expect their MSSP use to remain the same, while 19% expect it to increase and 10% expect it to decrease. Those that expect MSSP use to decrease are bringing more security operations in house to improve incident response and the quality of investigations. Those that expect it to increase are looking to external partners to improve investigations and scoping of potential incidents, and broaden security monitoring and monitoring coverage. Basically, choosing internal or external resources for security operations is most likely dependent on the availability of internal personnel, external services, and the comparative skill levels. As a result, there is some variance by country, with German organizations primarily interested in improving advanced threat detection with MSSPs, and UK outfits looking for help with technology such as big data platforms, analytics, and threat intelligence.<br>

Methods to address these goals include the three pillars of people, processes, and technology. Of the organizations that do not yet have all four types of security teams operating, 40% plan to deploy internal people into those roles within 12 to 18 months. Similarly, around 40% of organizations plan to increase their use of MSSP people within one or more of these security functions in that period. Deploying new security technology is another way to enhance capabilities, with more than 60% of organizations planning to invest in tools for these teams. Given the significant percentage of organizations that are not managing to triage and investigate all of their alerts, it is not surprising that key processes are the top two focus areas for new tools: improving the speed and accuracy of initial triage and prioritization of security alerts, and reducing the time and effort it takes to conduct incident investigations.<br>
paragraph 9 is :<br>
 SOCs are back and continuing to expand SOCs have returned from movie land and become critical components of an organization’s security posture. Data breaches are on the rise, whether from increased attacks or better detection, and SOCs can help security teams triage alerts, respond to incidents, coordinate investigations, and proactively hunt for threats. There is no perfect SOC model. Whether the SOC is internal or external, dedicated or multifunction, the important thing is to continue improving security operations, from reactive to proactive and optimized.<br>
paragraph 10 is :<br>
 Upgraded tools and capabilities still needed Although SOCs have become more common, most organizations are still overwhelmed with alerts and are unable to properly investigate one out of four, resulting in minor or moderate business impacts. As a result, most feel it is important to continue making improvements to their internal security capabilities, continue or increase their use of MSSPs, and invest in additional or enhanced tools.<br>

 In last year’s McAfee Labs 2016 Threats Predictions Report, we claimed that 2015’s spike in ransomware attacks would continue and that ransomware Not a day went by in 2016 in would be a major and rapidly growing threat in 2016. As predicted, 2016 may which ransomware did not make be remembered as “the year of ransomware,” with both a huge jump in the security industry headlines. number of ransomware attacks and significant technical advances in this type In this Key Topic, we highlight 2016’s many significant technical of attack. Through the end of Q3, the number of new ransomware samples enhancements in ransomware and this year totals 3,860,603, an increase of 80% since the beginning of the the progress the security industry year. Some of 2016’s most significant technical advancements in ransomware is making to fight back against the include partial or full disk encryption, encryption of websites used by threat. legitimate applications, anti-sandboxing, more sophisticated exploit kits for ransomware delivery, and ransomware-as-a-service. This Key Topic discusses these advancements and also some good news, including the newly formed anti-ransomware collaboration No More Ransom! and several successful ransomware control system takedowns.<br>
paragraph 10 is :<br>
A SOC is a facility in which —Douglas Frosst, Barbara Kay, Bart Lenaerts-Bergmans, and Rick Simon information systems (websites, applications, databases, data centers A few years ago, dedicated security operations centers (SOCs) seemed to be and servers, networks, desktops, going the way of the dinosaur—the era of big rooms with big monitors and teams and other endpoints) are monitored, of analysts seemed ready to be replaced by distributed teams, outsourced, or assessed, and defended. disbanded entirely. If you were not in the defense department or on Wall Street, many thought, then you did not need a SOC. Then targeted attacks and insider threats moved from movie and government plots to an everyday reality for enterprises. According to an Intel Security survey, 68% of investigations in 2015 involved a specific entity, either as a targeted external attack or an insider threat.<br>
paragraph 11 is :<br>
 Today, almost all commercial (1,000–5,000 employees) and enterprise (more than 5,000 employees) organizations run some type of SOC, and half of them have Almost all commercial and had one for more than a year, according to the latest research study from Intel enterprise organizations run some Security. As the number of incidents continues to increase, security organizations type of SOC. They are investing appear to be maturing and using what they learn to educate and improve more in SOCs and many have seen a decline in incident investigations. prevention in a virtuous cycle. For instance, survey respondents documented They attribute the decline to their expanding investments in SOCs and attributed an increase in investigations better protection and processes. to an improved ability to detect attacks. Those who reported a decline in investigations of incidents attributed this improvement to better protection and processes, which mature organizations perform as the final stage of a security investigation.<br>

paragraph 13 is :<br>
 intelligence, situational awareness and additional expertise; typically not involved in day-to-day operations.<br>
paragraph 14 is :<br>
 The ability to quickly identify, investigate, and resolve threats is probably the most important aspect of today’s security operations. Preventing 100% of attacks may never be achievable, but security information and event management (SIEM) often provides a real-time understanding of the world outside—threat data, reputation feeds, and vulnerability status—as well as a view of the systems, users, data, risks, and activities inside, obtained through continuous monitoring and correlation. Actionable intelligence and situational awareness delivered by a SIEM may help orchestrate security operations and, when an incident is detected, may enable better collaboration for faster incident response.<br>
paragraph 15 is :<br>
 Almost 70% of these organizations report using a SIEM solution today. Those organizations using external security services are highly likely (93%) to have those services involved with the SIEM in some fashion, most of them (71%) asking the MSSP to run day-to-day SIEM operations. Almost half (45%) of companies without a SIEM intend to deploy the functionality within the next 12 to 18 months.<br>
paragraph 16 is :<br>
 The majority of organizations (55%) reported that firewall logs are the primary source used for advanced threat detection and investigation, followed by endpoint logs (34%) and system logs (32%). Other data, such as logs from VPN activity, web proxies, DNS, and DHCP servers are used by 20% or less. Historical data, important for forensic investigations or historical correlation, is typically retained for between 45 and 60 days. Firewall logs, endpoint threat detection logs, and Active Directory logs are retained for the longest period.<br>
paragraph 17 is :<br>
Security analytics is of growing interest to help address the volume of alerts, and is already in use by 67% of these organizations. Detection is reported as the number one purpose today for analytics, but prioritization and risk assessment are likely to be the top two drivers for future adoption of security analytics during the next 12 to 18 months.<br>
paragraph 18 is :<br>
 Petya also brought on increasing ransom demands, doubling the amount if payment was not made within seven days. One ransomware variant threatened to delete one file per hour until the ransom was paid. Another encoded a series of ransom amounts, which it chose based on the name of the distribution file, making it quick and easy to make the demand fit the victim’s ability to pay. In another case, a hospital that paid the first ransom demand was then told to pay again if it wanted to regain access to all of the files. The hospital ignored the second demand, but it remains an ongoing concern that attackers will not be “honorable” in their actions and refuse to release encryption keys even after receiving payment.<br>
paragraph 19 is :<br>
 Originally a collaboration of four organizations, this initiative has since added 13 new law enforcement partners in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Colombia, France, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. No More Ransom! has allowed ransomware victims to avoid paying an estimated US$1.48 million (€1.35 million) in ransom payments to cybercriminals. The No More Ransom! portal has received more than 24.5 million visitors since its launch, for an average of 400,000 visitors per day.<br>
paragraph 20 is :<br>
 Most malicious applications today are rotten to the core. They serve one purpose, to profit bad actors, subjecting their victims to attacks. The tactical We see a trend toward objectives of such crimes are generally to reach the target, establish a presence, “Trojanizing” legitimate and persist for an extended time. To reach their targets, attackers either draw applications, which are injected victims in through social engineering or intercept their everyday computer with malicious nonreplicating code. usage, most often through exploitation. In either case, the goal is for those unfortunate enough to cross paths with malicious code to be none the wiser. The longer attacks can go unnoticed, the larger the payout. To this end, attackers are growing more sophisticated as they endeavor to create long lasting, fully undetectable creations. The more authentic-looking a piece of code, the more likely it is to be overlooked. This is the primary driving factor in an increasing trend of “Trojanizing” legitimate applications, which are injected with malicious nonreplicating code.<br>
paragraph 21 is :<br>
 The idea of riding on the coattails of popular applications harkens to the early days of malware creation, arguably with the inception decades ago of the very first parasitic file-infecting virus. Viruses differ from Trojans in that they recursively self-replicate, meaning that they spread to other files, those files in turn spread to other files, and so on. Part of the threat is the replication logic, which decides the files to target and where to insert malicious routines. Viruses can be analyzed and reverse engineered, and the replication logic and markers provide an additional detection surface for antivirus software. Parasitic Trojans, on the other hand, do not self-replicate, allowing for inserted code to be streamlined toward the desired payload without the additional overhead and corresponding detection surface. This can be an Achilles heel for defenses that are ill equipped to cope with such attacks.<br>
paragraph 22 is :<br>
Regardless of the distribution approach, the binaries are modified to take the place of desired or known applications. Binary patching is perhaps most heavily used today in the realm of Android apps. Kits such as AndroRat and Dendroid are responsible for tens of thousands of copycat apps concealing malicious payloads.<br>

We track the use of exploit kits in different campaigns and the vulnerabilities they exploit. By knowing which exploits are used, we inform our customers which patches they should prioritize to assist them in reducing their vulnerability to these attacks. Correlating our research with third-party data sources results in the following example:<br>
paragraph 3 is :<br>
 Binders/Joiners Binder programs first appeared in the 1990s and give malware distributors a quick and easy way to bundle their threats with other programs, documents, and multimedia files. Decoupling the malicious code from any social engineering aspects of an attack affords the perpetrators the benefit of customizing each binary for a given campaign, without having to code or recompile a threat. All that is required to build a new customized threat is to select current malware and accompanying files. The binder will combine all of them into a new executable ready for distribution. When a victim runs the program, both the malware and combined file will be run. Although binders do bundle clean and dirty files together, the result is a new piece of malware, which does not closely resemble a legitimate file.<br>

This type of encrypts the master file table. While the files are still on the disk and unaffected, ransomware encrypts the master file table, making files inaccessible. the encrypted file table prevents them from being located.

 Attacker benefits The abuse of reputable applications affords attackers a number of benefits. Payloads are concealed behind a recognizable brand, contributing to the impression of legitimacy and helping ensure targeted users take the bait. This brand recognition continues after a system has been compromised, through recognizable directory, file, process, and registry key names and attributes. These elements can provide cover during security scans and forensics analysis, with recognizable properties blending with hundreds or even thousands of familiar programs.<br>

paragraph 17 is :<br>
 BackDoor Factory (BDF) is a popular open-source executable binary patcher that supports Windows, Mac, and Linux binary patching. Target programs are modified to include predefined or user-specified shellcode. BDF allows the operator to specify many options, including the host IP, port, and where to insert the shellcode within the target. Code can be placed in the slack space of a program and spread over one or more cavities, thus maintaining the original file size and executable geometry. This tactic may render certain feature vectors ineffective in machine learning algorithms applied to such threats.<br>
paragraph 18 is :<br>
 The Backdoor Factory Proxy (BDFProxy) takes BDF a step further by patching executables on the fly as they are downloaded, leveraging a man-in-the- middle attack posture. Joshua Pitts, the author of the BDF tools, discovered this approach was actively being used in the wild in 2014 when applications were downloaded via a Tor exit node in Russia. This discovery was made within about an hour after the beginning of his search. In particular, all uncompressed Windows executable files served over nonsecured HTTP connections were modified to include the OnionDuke malware.<br>

 Petya also brought on increasing ransom demands, doubling the amount if payment was not made within seven days. One ransomware variant threatened to delete one file per hour until the ransom was paid. Another encoded a series of ransom amounts, which it chose based on the name of the distribution file, making it quick and easy to make the demand fit the victim’s ability to pay. In another case, a hospital that paid the first ransom demand was then told to pay again if it wanted to regain access to all of the files. The hospital ignored the second demand, but it remains an ongoing concern that attackers will not be “honorable” in their actions and refuse to release encryption keys even after receiving payment.<br>

 The ability to quickly identify, investigate, and resolve threats is probably the most important aspect of today’s security operations.

 Intel Security commissioned a primary research study to gain a deeper understanding of the ways in which enterprises are using security operations Intel Security surveyed security centers (SOCs), how they have changed over time, and what they will look like practitioners to better understand in the future. We interviewed almost 400 security practitioners across several how enterprises are using SOCs, geographies, industries, and company sizes.

paragraph 5 is :<br>
 Almost nine out of 10 organizations in this study reported that they have an internal or external SOC, although commercial organizations are slightly less likely to have one (84%) compared with enterprises (91%). Smaller organizations in general are implementing SOCs a bit later than enterprises, as only 44% of commercial groups have had one for more than 12 months, whereas 56% of enterprise SOCs have been around for that long. Most SOCs (60%) are currently run internally, with 23% operating a mix of internal and external support, and 17% fully external. For the few that have not established a SOC, only 2% of enterprises have no plans to do so, versus 7% of commercial companies.<br>
paragraph 6 is :<br>
 Of the 88% of organizations operating a SOC, the majority (56%) reported that they use a multifunction model combining SOC and network operations center About half of organizations that (NOC) functionality.

paragraph 8 is :<br>
 For the next 12 to 18 months, most organizations (71%) expect their MSSP use to remain the same, while 19% expect it to increase and 10% expect it to decrease. Those that expect MSSP use to decrease are bringing more security operations in house to improve incident response and the quality of investigations. Those that expect it to increase are looking to external partners to improve investigations and scoping of potential incidents, and broaden security monitoring and monitoring coverage. Basically, choosing internal or external resources for security operations is most likely dependent on the availability of internal personnel, external services, and the comparative skill levels. As a result, there is some variance by country, with German organizations primarily interested in improving advanced threat detection with MSSPs, and UK outfits looking for help with technology such as big data platforms, analytics, and threat intelligence.<br>
paragraph 9 is :<br>
 Almost 70% of these organizations report using a SIEM solution today. Those organizations using external security services are highly likely (93%) to have those services involved with the SIEM in some fashion, most of them (71%) asking the MSSP to run day-to-day SIEM operations.

Methods to address these goals include the three pillars of people, processes, and technology. Of the organizations that do not yet have all four types of security teams operating, 40% plan to deploy internal people into those roles within 12 to 18 months. Similarly, around 40% of organizations plan to increase their use of MSSP people within one or more of these security functions in that period. Deploying new security technology is another way to enhance capabilities, with more than 60% of organizations planning to invest in tools for these teams. Given the significant percentage of organizations that are not managing to triage and investigate all of their alerts, it is not surprising that key processes are the top two focus areas for new tools: improving the speed and accuracy of initial triage and prioritization of security alerts, and reducing the time and effort it takes to conduct incident investigations.<br>

 Attacker benefits The abuse of reputable applications affords attackers a number of benefits. Payloads are concealed behind a recognizable brand, contributing to the impression of legitimacy and helping ensure targeted users take the bait.

These elements can provide cover during security scans and forensics analysis, with recognizable properties blending with hundreds or even thousands of familiar programs.<br>

 Another benefit is built-in persistence, or a method of restarting code that was previously terminated. Malware persistence falls into one of two categories: self- persistence, involving the installation of start-up hooks to endure reboots; and companion-persistence, which leverages existing start-up hooks to automatically load before, during, or after other wanted applications. Each system change made by malicious code is an indicator of compromise. Thus the fewer the number of changes, the smaller the detection surface. Trojanizing legitimate applications provides free persistence; the software’s natural method of start-up is all that is necessary for the malicious code to load. In fact, if the program is run manually on a regular basis, then persistence is self-perpetuated by the victims themselves.<br>

 Almost nine out of 10 organizations in this study reported that they have an internal or external SOC, although commercial organizations are slightly less likely to have one (84%) compared with enterprises (91%). Smaller organizations in general are implementing SOCs a bit later than enterprises, as only 44% of commercial groups have had one for more than 12 months, whereas 56% of enterprise SOCs have been around for that long. Most SOCs (60%) are currently run internally, with 23% operating a mix of internal and external support, and 17% fully external. For the few that have not established a SOC, only 2% of enterprises have no plans to do so, versus 7% of commercial companies.<br>

 The majority of organizations (55%) reported that firewall logs are the primary source used for advanced threat detection and investigation, followed by endpoint logs (34%) and system logs (32%). Other data, such as logs from VPN activity, web proxies, DNS, and DHCP servers are used by 20% or less. Historical data, important for forensic investigations or historical correlation, is typically retained for between 45 and 60 days. Firewall logs, endpoint threat detection logs, and Active Directory logs are retained for the longest period.<br>

 Most malicious applications today are rotten to the core. They serve one purpose, to profit bad actors, subjecting their victims to attacks. The tactical We see a trend toward objectives of such crimes are generally to reach the target, establish a presence, “Trojanizing” legitimate and persist for an extended time. To reach their targets, attackers either draw applications, which are injected victims in through social engineering or intercept their everyday computer with malicious nonreplicating code. usage, most often through exploitation. In either case, the goal is for those unfortunate enough to cross paths with malicious code to be none the wiser. The longer attacks can go unnoticed, the larger the payout. To this end, attackers are growing more sophisticated as they endeavor to create long lasting, fully undetectable creations. The more authentic-looking a piece of code, the more likely it is to be overlooked. This is the primary driving factor in an increasing trend of “Trojanizing” legitimate applications, which are injected with malicious nonreplicating code.<br>

 Another benefit is built-in persistence, or a method of restarting code that was previously terminated. Malware persistence falls into one of two categories: self- persistence, involving the installation of start-up hooks to endure reboots; and companion-persistence, which leverages existing start-up hooks to automatically load before, during, or after other wanted applications. Each system change made by malicious code is an indicator of compromise. Thus the fewer the number of changes, the smaller the detection surface. Trojanizing legitimate applications provides free persistence; the software’s natural method of start-up is all that is necessary for the malicious code to load. In fact, if the program is run manually on a regular basis, then persistence is self-perpetuated by the victims themselves.<br>

 Earlier this year, the Internet blew up over the topic of whether Apple should assist the FBI by providing access to a deceased terrorist’s iPhone. Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, referred to government’s demands as asking for the “equivalent of a master key, capable of opening hundreds of millions of locks.” In the end, the FBI gained access through undisclosed means and withdrew the request, but the notion of backdoor access is something that has been coveted by malware authors, spies, and nation-states for decades. Tactics for accomplishing this goal range from persuading victims via social engineering to hand over the keys to their devices, to intercepting hardware in the supply chain and inserting backdoors to surreptitiously gain remote access. However, the most common method is through the deployment of Trojan software.<br>

 Binders/Joiners Binder programs first appeared in the 1990s and give malware distributors a quick and easy way to bundle their threats with other programs, documents, and multimedia files. Decoupling the malicious code from any social engineering aspects of an attack affords the perpetrators the benefit of customizing each binary for a given campaign, without having to code or recompile a threat. All that is required to build a new customized threat is to select current malware and accompanying files. The binder will combine all of them into a new executable ready for distribution. When a victim runs the program, both the malware and combined file will be run. Although binders do bundle clean and dirty files together, the result is a new piece of malware, which does not closely resemble a legitimate file.<br>

In 2015 and the first half of 2016, the Angler exploit kit was the most popular mechanism for delivering ransomware to potential victims. These exploit kits are popular and have a strong support system. However, in April and May, the volume of Angler traffic dropped dramatically, eventually shutting down completely. It appeared to have been replaced in popularity by Neutrino, although at nowhere near Angler’s volume of traffic. Another shift in exploit kits happened in September, with RIG rising to challenge Neutrino for top spot.

 The ability to quickly identify, investigate, and resolve threats is probably the most important aspect of today’s security operations. Preventing 100% of attacks may never be achievable, but security information and event management (SIEM) often provides a real-time understanding of the world outside—threat data, reputation feeds, and vulnerability status—as well as a view of the systems, users, data, risks, and activities inside, obtained through continuous monitoring and correlation.

 Attacker benefits The abuse of reputable applications affords attackers a number of benefits. Payloads are concealed behind a recognizable brand, contributing to the impression of legitimacy and helping ensure targeted users take the bait.

These elements can provide cover during security scans and forensics analysis, with recognizable properties blending with hundreds or even thousands of familiar programs.<br>

Those that expect it to increase are looking to external partners to improve investigations and scoping of potential incidents, and broaden security monitoring and monitoring coverage. Basically, choosing internal or external resources for security operations is most likely dependent on the availability of internal personnel, external services, and the comparative skill levels.

 Attacker benefits The abuse of reputable applications affords attackers a number of benefits. Payloads are concealed behind a recognizable brand, contributing to the impression of legitimacy and helping ensure targeted users take the bait. This brand recognition continues after a system has been compromised, through recognizable directory, file, process, and registry key names and attributes. These elements can provide cover during security scans and forensics analysis, with recognizable properties blending with hundreds or even thousands of familiar programs.<br>

 These attack scenarios apply to the majority of Internet users. Even those who seldom install new applications are likely to have existing applications configured for autoupdates. It is still commonplace for update servers to deliver binaries over insecure HTTP connections. Connecting to open Wi-Fi hotspots provides others an opportunity to carry out man-in-the-middle attacks. Running untrusted programs remains a significant attack vector, and the ever-growing use of shared libraries increases the overall risk, especially as it pertains to mobile devices and the Internet of Things.<br>

 This distribution of SOC implementations has several implications. The majority operate at or past the midpoint of SOC maturity, progressing toward the goal of a More than a quarter of surveyed proactive and optimized security operation. However, more than a quarter (26%) businesses still operate in reactive still operate in reactive mode, with ad-hoc approaches to security operations, mode, with ad-hoc approaches to threat hunting, and incident response. This can significantly extend detection security operations, threat hunting, and incident response. and response times, leaving the business at greater risk of significant damage, as well as facing a higher cleanup cost.<br>
paragraph 5 is :<br>
 The small group that reported a decrease in incidents overwhelmingly (96%) believe that this was due to better prevention and processes. Of those who said that incidents increased, the majority feel that it was due to a combination of improved detection capabilities (73%) and more attacks (57%).<br>
paragraph 6 is :<br>
 For the next 12 to 18 months, most organizations (71%) expect their MSSP use to remain the same, while 19% expect it to increase and 10% expect it to decrease. Those that expect MSSP use to decrease are bringing more security operations in house to improve incident response and the quality of investigations. Those that expect it to increase are looking to external partners to improve investigations and scoping of potential incidents, and broaden security monitoring and monitoring coverage. Basically, choosing internal or external resources for security operations is most likely dependent on the availability of internal personnel, external services, and the comparative skill levels. As a result, there is some variance by country, with German organizations primarily interested in improving advanced threat detection with MSSPs, and UK outfits looking for help with technology such as big data platforms, analytics, and threat intelligence.<br>
paragraph 7 is :<br>
 The ability to quickly identify, investigate, and resolve threats is probably the most important aspect of today’s security operations. Preventing 100% of attacks may never be achievable, but security information and event management (SIEM) often provides a real-time understanding of the world outside—threat data, reputation feeds, and vulnerability status—as well as a view of the systems, users, data, risks, and activities inside, obtained through continuous monitoring and correlation. Actionable intelligence and situational awareness delivered by a SIEM may help orchestrate security operations and, when an incident is detected, may enable better collaboration for faster incident response.<br>

 The majority of organizations (55%) reported that firewall logs are the primary source used for advanced threat detection and investigation, followed by endpoint logs (34%) and system logs (32%). Other data, such as logs from VPN activity, web proxies, DNS, and DHCP servers are used by 20% or less. Historical data, important for forensic investigations or historical correlation, is typically retained for between 45 and 60 days. Firewall logs, endpoint threat detection logs, and Active Directory logs are retained for the longest period.<br>

 Next, shift the emphasis to time to detection, containment, and remediation. These times are the most effective way to focus attention and resources where they are most needed. Reducing these security times usually requires a combination of integration, automation, and improving workflows. Anywhere that the number of process steps can be reduced, human interaction eliminated, or duplication removed should be priorities.<br>
paragraph 14 is :<br>
 SOCs are back and continuing to expand SOCs have returned from movie land and become critical components of an organization’s security posture. Data breaches are on the rise, whether from increased attacks or better detection, and SOCs can help security teams triage alerts, respond to incidents, coordinate investigations, and proactively hunt for threats. There is no perfect SOC model. Whether the SOC is internal or external, dedicated or multifunction, the important thing is to continue improving security operations, from reactive to proactive and optimized.<br>
paragraph 15 is :<br>
 Three major investment priorities During the next 12 to 18 months, organizations plan to invest in three major areas to improve their capabilities: responsiveness, detection, and investigation. Methods of improvement vary by country, organization size, and other attributes. These appear to be dependent on the availability of local resources, whether skilled security personnel, new and enhanced tools, or capable MSSPs.<br>

 Suspicious files are often sent to a “sandbox” for evaluation before being allowed to run on a user’s system. This year, ransomware attackers learned The common “sandbox” method how to differentiate between a sandbox, which is usually a virtual machine, used to detect ransomware can and a live human’s device. In a recent case, Locky, the culprit in many of now be detected and evaded by the hospital ransomware attacks, used encrypted code and execution time some ransomware. differences between real and virtual machines to evade detection. Two API calls, GetProcessHeap() and CloseHandle(), one of which should be about 10 times faster on a real system, are run by the malware, which goes dormant if the execution time difference is not as large as expected.<br>

paragraph 19 is :<br>
 Most malicious applications today are rotten to the core. They serve one purpose, to profit bad actors, subjecting their victims to attacks. The tactical We see a trend toward objectives of such crimes are generally to reach the target, establish a presence, “Trojanizing” legitimate and persist for an extended time. To reach their targets, attackers either draw applications, which are injected victims in through social engineering or intercept their everyday computer with malicious nonreplicating code. usage, most often through exploitation. In either case, the goal is for those unfortunate enough to cross paths with malicious code to be none the wiser. The longer attacks can go unnoticed, the larger the payout. To this end, attackers are growing more sophisticated as they endeavor to create long lasting, fully undetectable creations. The more authentic-looking a piece of code, the more likely it is to be overlooked. This is the primary driving factor in an increasing trend of “Trojanizing” legitimate applications, which are injected with malicious nonreplicating code.<br>
paragraph 20 is :<br>
 Another benefit is built-in persistence, or a method of restarting code that was previously terminated. Malware persistence falls into one of two categories: self- persistence, involving the installation of start-up hooks to endure reboots; and companion-persistence, which leverages existing start-up hooks to automatically load before, during, or after other wanted applications. Each system change made by malicious code is an indicator of compromise. Thus the fewer the number of changes, the smaller the detection surface. Trojanizing legitimate applications provides free persistence; the software’s natural method of start-up is all that is necessary for the malicious code to load. In fact, if the program is run manually on a regular basis, then persistence is self-perpetuated by the victims themselves.<br>
paragraph 21 is :<br>
 The idea of riding on the coattails of popular applications harkens to the early days of malware creation, arguably with the inception decades ago of the very first parasitic file-infecting virus. Viruses differ from Trojans in that they recursively self-replicate, meaning that they spread to other files, those files in turn spread to other files, and so on. Part of the threat is the replication logic, which decides the files to target and where to insert malicious routines. Viruses can be analyzed and reverse engineered, and the replication logic and markers provide an additional detection surface for antivirus software. Parasitic Trojans, on the other hand, do not self-replicate, allowing for inserted code to be streamlined toward the desired payload without the additional overhead and corresponding detection surface. This can be an Achilles heel for defenses that are ill equipped to cope with such attacks.<br>
